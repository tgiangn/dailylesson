<h2>Harry Potter and the Half-Blooded Prince</h2>
<p>Millenium breaking disaster...</p>
<p>All river traffic has been halted and police divers search for survivors.</p>
<p>Surrounding area remains closed.</p>
<p>The man, known to... Harry Potter.</p>
<p>Who's Harry Potter?</p>
<p>Um, no one.</p>
<p>Bit of a tosser, really.</p>
<p>Funny that paper of yours.</p>
<p>Couple of minutes ago, I could have sworn I saw a picture move.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>While I was going around the train.</p>
<p>Okay, I was wondering--</p>
<p>Eleven.</p>
<p>That's when I get off.</p>
<p>You can tell me all about that tosser Harry Potter.</p>
<p>You've been reckless this summer, Harry.</p>
<p>I like riding around the trains.</p>
<p>Takes my mind off things.</p>
<p>All unpleasant to be old,</p>
<p>isn't it?</p>
<p>The tale is thrilling,</p>
<p>if I say so myself.</p>
<p>But now is not the time</p>
<p>to tell it.</p>
<p>Take my arm.</p>
<p>Do as I say.</p>
<p>I hardly just Apparated,</p>
<p>didn't I?</p>
<p>Indeed.</p>
<p>Quite successfully too,</p>
<p>I might add.</p>
<p>Most people vomit</p>
<p>the first time.</p>
<p>Can't imagine why.</p>
<p>Welcome to the charming village</p>
<p>of Budleigh Babberton.</p>
<p>Harry, I assume right about now</p>
<p>you must be wondering...</p>
<p>why I brought you here?</p>
<p>Am I right?</p>
<p>Actually sir, after all these years,</p>
<p>I just, sort of, go with it.</p>
<p>Wands on, Harry.</p>
<p>Horace!</p>
<p>Horace.</p>
<p>Merlin's beard!</p>
<p>You don't need</p>
<p>to disfigure me, Albus.</p>
<p>Well I must say you made</p>
<p>a very convincing armchair, Horace.</p>
<p>It's all</p>
<p>in the upholstery.</p>
<p>I come by this stuffing naturally.</p>
<p>What gave me away?</p>
<p>Dragon's blood.</p>
<p>Oh yes, introductions.</p>
<p>Harry, I'd like you to meet</p>
<p>an old friend and colleague of mine--</p>
<p>Horace Slughorn.</p>
<p>Horace...</p>
<p>Well you know who this is.</p>
<p>Harry Potter.</p>
<p>So for love of theatrics,</p>
<p>Horace...</p>
<p>You're, by any chance,</p>
<p>waiting for someone else, were you?</p>
<p>Someone else?</p>
<p>I'm sure I don't know what you mean.</p>
<p>Alright. The Death Eaters</p>
<p>have been trying</p>
<p>to recruit me</p>
<p>for over a year.</p>
<p>Do you know</p>
<p>what's that like?</p>
<p>You can only say no</p>
<p>to these people so many times.</p>
<p>So I never stay anywhere</p>
<p>more than a week.</p>
<p>The Muggles who own this place</p>
<p>are in the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>Well, I think we should put it</p>
<p>back in order for them,</p>
<p>don't you?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Fine.</p>
<p>That was fun.</p>
<p>Do you mind</p>
<p>if I use the loo?</p>
<p>No, of course.</p>
<p>Don't think I don't know</p>
<p>why you're here, Albus.</p>
<p>The answer is still no.</p>
<p>Absolutely,</p>
<p>and unequivanetly, no.</p>
<p>You're very like</p>
<p>your father.</p>
<p>Except the eyes,</p>
<p>of course.</p>
<p>You have your--</p>
<p>My mother's eyes, yeah.</p>
<p>Lily, lovely Lily.</p>
<p>She's exceedingly bright,</p>
<p>your mother.</p>
<p>Even more impressive</p>
<p>even though I could say</p>
<p>that she was Muggle-born.</p>
<p>One of my best friends</p>
<p>is Muggle-born.</p>
<p>She's the best in our year.</p>
<p>Oh please don't think</p>
<p>I'm prejudiced.</p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>Your mother was</p>
<p>one of my absolute favorites.</p>
<p>Look, there she is.</p>
<p>Right at the front.</p>
<p>All mine.</p>
<p>Each and every one.</p>
<p>Ex-students, I mean.</p>
<p>You recognise Barnabas Cuffe?</p>
<p>Editor of the Daily Prophet.</p>
<p>Always takes my owl</p>
<p>should I wish to register an opinion</p>
<p>on the news of the day.</p>
<p>Gwenog Jones,</p>
<p>captain of the Holyhead Harpies.</p>
<p>Free tickets</p>
<p>whenever I want them.</p>
<p>Of course, I haven't been</p>
<p>to a match in some time.</p>
<p>Ah, yes!</p>
<p>Regulus Black.</p>
<p>No doubt, there is</p>
<p>his older brother Sirius,</p>
<p>died a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>I taught the whole Black family,</p>
<p>except Sirius.</p>
<p>It's a shame.</p>
<p>A talented boy.</p>
<p>I got Regulus when</p>
<p>he came along, of course, but...</p>
<p>but I'd like to set.</p>
<p>Horace!</p>
<p>Do you mind if I take this?</p>
<p>I do love</p>
<p>knitting patterns.</p>
<p>Yes, of course,</p>
<p>but you're not leaving, are you?</p>
<p>Oh, I think I know</p>
<p>a lost cause when I see one.</p>
<p>Regrettable, I would have considered it</p>
<p>a very personal triumph</p>
<p>if you consented</p>
<p>to return to Hogwarts.</p>
<p>Ah well, you're like my friend</p>
<p>Mr. Potter here.</p>
<p>One of a kind.</p>
<p>Well, bye-bye Horace.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
<p>Alright. I'll do it.</p>
<p>But I want Professor Merrythought's</p>
<p>old office,</p>
<p>not the water closet</p>
<p>I had before.</p>
<p>And I expect a raise.</p>
<p>These are mad times</p>
<p>we're living, mad!</p>
<p>They are, indeed.</p>
<p>Sir, exactly what was</p>
<p>all that about?</p>
<p>You are talented,</p>
<p>famous and powerful.</p>
<p>Everything Horace values.</p>
<p>Professor Slughorn's gonna try</p>
<p>to collect you, Harry.</p>
<p>You would be</p>
<p>his crowning jewel.</p>
<p>That's why</p>
<p>he's returning to Hogwarts.</p>
<p>And it's crucial</p>
<p>he should return.</p>
<p>I fear I may have stolen</p>
<p>a wondrous night from you, Harry.</p>
<p>She was truthfully...</p>
<p>very pretty.</p>
<p>The girl.</p>
<p>It's alright, sir.</p>
<p>I'll go back tomorrow,</p>
<p>make some excuse.</p>
<p>Oh you'll not be returning</p>
<p>to Little Whinging tonight, Harry.</p>
<p>But sir, what about Hedwig?</p>
<p>And my trunk?</p>
<p>Both</p>
<p>are waiting for you.</p>
<p>Hedwig?</p>
<p>Mom?</p>
<p>Ginny, what is it?</p>
<p>I was only wondering</p>
<p>when Harry got here.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Harry-- Harry, who?</p>
<p>Harry Potter, of course.</p>
<p>I think I'd know if Harry Potter</p>
<p>was in my house, wouldn't I?</p>
<p>His trunk's in the kitchen...</p>
<p>and his owl.</p>
<p>But no, dear.</p>
<p>I seriously doubt that.</p>
<p>Harry?</p>
<p>Did someone say Harry?</p>
<p>Me, nosey.</p>
<p>Is he up there with you?</p>
<p>Of course not.</p>
<p>I think I'll know if my best friend's</p>
<p>in my room, wouldn't I?</p>
<p>Is that an owl I heard?</p>
<p>You haven't seen him,</p>
<p>have you?</p>
<p>Apparently, he's wandering</p>
<p>about the house.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Really.</p>
<p>Harry!</p>
<p>Harry.</p>
<p>What a lovely surprise!</p>
<p>Why didn't you let us know</p>
<p>you were coming?</p>
<p>I didn't know.</p>
<p>Dumbledore.</p>
<p>Oh, that man!</p>
<p>What we won't do without him?</p>
<p>A bit of... toothpaste.</p>
<p>So when did you</p>
<p>get here?</p>
<p>A few days ago.</p>
<p>Day or for a while,</p>
<p>I wasn't sure I was coming.</p>
<p>Mum...</p>
<p>sort of lost it, last week.</p>
<p>Said Ginny and I have</p>
<p>no business going back to Hogwarts.</p>
<p>It's too dangerous.</p>
<p>Oh, come on.</p>
<p>She's not alone.</p>
<p>Even my parents.</p>
<p>They're Muggles,</p>
<p>know something</p>
<p>bad's happening.</p>
<p>Anyway,</p>
<p>Dad stepped in.</p>
<p>Told us she was</p>
<p>being barmy and...</p>
<p>Took a few days,</p>
<p>but she came around.</p>
<p>But, this is Hogwarts</p>
<p>we're talking about.</p>
<p>It's Dumbledore.</p>
<p>What could be safer?</p>
<p>There's been a lot of talk</p>
<p>recently that...</p>
<p>Dumbledore's</p>
<p>got a bit old.</p>
<p>What rubbish!</p>
<p>Well, he's only...</p>
<p>How old is he?</p>
<p>Give or take a few years?</p>
<p>Cissy, you can't do this!</p>
<p>He can't be trusted.</p>
<p>The Dark Lord trusts him.</p>
<p>The Dark Lord is mistaken.</p>
<p>Run along, Wormtail.</p>
<p>I-I know</p>
<p>I ought not to be here.</p>
<p>The Dark Lord himself</p>
<p>forbade me to speak of this.</p>
<p>If the Dark Lord has forbidden it,</p>
<p>you would not to speak.</p>
<p>Put it down, Bella, we mustn't</p>
<p>touch what isn't ours.</p>
<p>As it, so happens,</p>
<p>I'm aware of your situation, Narcissa.</p>
<p>You?</p>
<p>The Dark Lord told you?</p>
<p>Your sister darts me.</p>
<p>Understandable, over the years,</p>
<p>I've played my part well.</p>
<p>So well, I've deceived one of</p>
<p>the greatest wizards of all time.</p>
<p>Dumbledore is a great wizard.</p>
<p>Only a fool would question it.</p>
<p>I don't doubt you, Severus.</p>
<p>You should be honored,</p>
<p>Cissy.</p>
<p>As should Draco.</p>
<p>He's just a boy.</p>
<p>I can't change</p>
<p>the Dark Lord's mind.</p>
<p>But it might be possible</p>
<p>for me to help Draco.</p>
<p>Severus.</p>
<p>Swear to it.</p>
<p>Make the Unbreakable Vow.</p>
<p>It's just empty words.</p>
<p>You'll give it his best effort...</p>
<p>when it matters most.</p>
<p>He'll just slither back</p>
<p>to his hole.</p>
<p>Coward.</p>
<p>Take out your wand.</p>
<p>Will you, Severus Snape,</p>
<p>watch over Draco Malfoy</p>
<p>as he attempts to fulfill</p>
<p>the Dark Lord's wishes?</p>
<p>I will.</p>
<p>And will you,</p>
<p>to the best of your ability,</p>
<p>protect him from harm?</p>
<p>I will.</p>
<p>And if Draco should fail,</p>
<p>will you yourself</p>
<p>carry out the deed</p>
<p>the Dark Lord has ordered</p>
<p>Draco to perform?</p>
<p>I will.</p>
<p>Step up, step up!</p>
<p>We got fating fancies.</p>
<p>And he's made me go.</p>
<p>At just in for time for school.</p>
<p>Puking Pastilles.</p>
<p>Meeting's in the cauldron,</p>
<p>Hanson.</p>
<p>Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder.</p>
<p>How real many spinned it at that one?</p>
<p>Handy if you need</p>
<p>to make a quick getaway.</p>
<p>Hello, ladies.</p>
<p>Love potions, eh?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>They really do work.</p>
<p>Then again the way</p>
<p>we heard you, sis...</p>
<p>You're doing just fine</p>
<p>on your own.</p>
<p>Meaning?</p>
<p>Are you not currently dating</p>
<p>Dean Thomas?</p>
<p>It's none of your business.</p>
<p>How much for this?</p>
<p>Five galleons.</p>
<p>Five galleons.</p>
<p>How much for me?</p>
<p>Five galleons.</p>
<p>Five galleons.</p>
<p>I'm your brother.</p>
<p>Ten galleons.</p>
<p>Ten galleons.</p>
<p>Come on, let's go.</p>
<p>Hi, Ron.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>How are Fred and George</p>
<p>doing it?</p>
<p>Half the alley's</p>
<p>closed down.</p>
<p>Fred reckons people</p>
<p>need a laugh these days.</p>
<p>I reckon he's right.</p>
<p>Oh, no.</p>
<p>Everyone got their wands</p>
<p>from Ollivanders.</p>
<p>Harry...</p>
<p>Is it me</p>
<p>or do Draco and Mummy</p>
<p>look like two people who</p>
<p>don't want to be followed?</p>
<p>Quibbler!</p>
<p>Quibbler.</p>
<p>He's lovely.</p>
<p>They've been known to sing</p>
<p>at Boxing Day, you know?</p>
<p>Quibbler?</p>
<p>Oh, please.</p>
<p>What's a Wrackspurt?</p>
<p>Invisible creatures,</p>
<p>they flow in your ears</p>
<p>and make your brain go fuzzy.</p>
<p>Quibbler!</p>
<p>So what was Draco doing</p>
<p>with that weird-looking cabinet?</p>
<p>And who were</p>
<p>all those people?</p>
<p>Don't you see?</p>
<p>It was a ceremony.</p>
<p>An initiation.</p>
<p>Stop it, Harry.</p>
<p>I know where you're going with this.</p>
<p>It happened.</p>
<p>He's one of them.</p>
<p>One of who?</p>
<p>Harry's under the impression</p>
<p>Draco Malfoy is now a Death Eater.</p>
<p>You're barking.</p>
<p>What would You-Know-Who want</p>
<p>with a sod like Malfoy?</p>
<p>Oh, then what's he doing</p>
<p>in Borgin and Burkes?</p>
<p>Browsing for furniture?</p>
<p>It's a creepy shop.</p>
<p>He's a creepy blood.</p>
<p>Blood? His father is a Death Eater.</p>
<p>It only makes sense.</p>
<p>Besides, Hermione saw it</p>
<p>with her own eyes.</p>
<p>I told you,</p>
<p>I don't know what I saw.</p>
<p>I need some air.</p>
<p>What's going on?</p>
<p>He's probably on the platform.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>Didn't Mummy ever tell you</p>
<p>it was rude to eavesdrop, Potter?</p>
<p>Petrificus Totalus!</p>
<p>Oh yeah...</p>
<p>She was dead before you could</p>
<p>wipe the drool off your chin.</p>
<p>That's for my father.</p>
<p>Enjoy your ride</p>
<p>back to London.</p>
<p>Ennervate!</p>
<p>Hello, Harry!</p>
<p>Luna.</p>
<p>How'd you know where I was?</p>
<p>Wrapspurts,</p>
<p>your head's full of them.</p>
<p>Sorry I made you miss the carriages,</p>
<p>by the way, Luna.</p>
<p>That's alright.</p>
<p>It was like being with a friend.</p>
<p>Well,</p>
<p>I am your friend, Luna.</p>
<p>That's nice.</p>
<p>Oh, about time.</p>
<p>I've been looking</p>
<p>all over for you two.</p>
<p>Right...</p>
<p>Names?</p>
<p>Professor Flitwick,</p>
<p>you know me for five years.</p>
<p>No exceptions, Potter.</p>
<p>Who are those people?</p>
<p>Aurors.</p>
<p>Security.</p>
<p>What's this cane here then?</p>
<p>It's not a cane, you cretin.</p>
<p>It's a walking stick.</p>
<p>And what exactly will</p>
<p>you be doing with all...</p>
<p>be construed</p>
<p>as an offensive weapon.</p>
<p>It's alright, Mr. Filch.</p>
<p>I can vouch for Mr. Malfoy.</p>
<p>Nice face, Potter.</p>
<p>Would you like me</p>
<p>to fix it for you?</p>
<p>Personally, I think</p>
<p>you look a bit more...</p>
<p>devil may care</p>
<p>this way but...</p>
<p>It's up to you.</p>
<p>Well, have you ever</p>
<p>fixed a nose before?</p>
<p>No, but I've done</p>
<p>several toes...</p>
<p>How different</p>
<p>are they really?</p>
<p>Um, okay, yeah.</p>
<p>Give it a go.</p>
<p>Episkey!</p>
<p>How do I look?</p>
<p>Exceptionally ordinary.</p>
<p>Brilliant!</p>
<p>Hermione...</p>
<p>I'm here in a minute.</p>
<p>Will you stop eating?</p>
<p>Your best friend is missing.</p>
<p>Why won't you</p>
<p>turn around, you lunatic?</p>
<p>He's covered in blood again.</p>
<p>Why is it</p>
<p>he's always covered in blood?</p>
<p>Looks like it's his own</p>
<p>this time.</p>
<p>Where have you been?</p>
<p>What happened to your face?</p>
<p>Later.</p>
<p>What did I miss?</p>
<p>The Sorting Hat says we ought to be</p>
<p>brave and strong in these trouble times.</p>
<p>Easy for it to say, though.</p>
<p>It's a hat, isn't it?</p>
<p>Very best of evenings to you all.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>First off, let me introduce</p>
<p>the newest member of our staff.</p>
<p>Horace Slughorn.</p>
<p>Professor Slughorn, I'm happy to say,</p>
<p>has agreed to resume his old post...</p>
<p>as Potions Master.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the post of</p>
<p>Defense Against the Dark Arts...</p>
<p>will be taken by</p>
<p>Professor Snape.</p>
<p>As you know,</p>
<p>each and every one of you</p>
<p>were searched</p>
<p>upon your arrival here tonight.</p>
<p>And you have the right</p>
<p>to know why.</p>
<p>Once,</p>
<p>there was a young man.</p>
<p>Like you,</p>
<p>sat in this very hall.</p>
<p>Walked this castle's corridors.</p>
<p>Slept under it's roof.</p>
<p>You see, to all the world,</p>
<p>a student like any other.</p>
<p>His name:</p>
<p>Tom Riddle.</p>
<p>Today of course, is known</p>
<p>all over the world by another name.</p>
<p>Which is why</p>
<p>as I stand,</p>
<p>looking out</p>
<p>upon you all tonight,</p>
<p>I'm reminded</p>
<p>of a sobering fact.</p>
<p>Every day, every hour,</p>
<p>this very minute, perhaps...</p>
<p>dark forces attempt</p>
<p>to penetrate this castle's walls.</p>
<p>But in the end,</p>
<p>that greatest weapon...</p>
<p>is you.</p>
<p>Just something</p>
<p>to think about.</p>
<p>Now off to bed,</p>
<p>beep beep.</p>
<p>That was cheerful.</p>
<p>History of Magic is upstairs,</p>
<p>ladies, not down.</p>
<p>Mr. Davis, Mr. Davis,</p>
<p>that is the girls' lavatory.</p>
<p>Potter.</p>
<p>Oh, this can't be good.</p>
<p>Enjoying ourselves,</p>
<p>are we?</p>
<p>I had a free period</p>
<p>this morning, Professor.</p>
<p>So I noticed.</p>
<p>I would think you would want</p>
<p>to fill it with Potions.</p>
<p>Or is it no longer your ambition</p>
<p>to become an Auror?</p>
<p>Well, it was, but I was told to have</p>
<p>to get an Outstanding in my O.W.L.</p>
<p>So you did, when Professor Snape</p>
<p>was teaching Potions.</p>
<p>However, Professor Slughorn's</p>
<p>perfectly happy</p>
<p>to accept N.E.W.T. students</p>
<p>with "Exceeds Expectations".</p>
<p>Brilliant, um...</p>
<p>Well, I'll head there straight away.</p>
<p>Oh, good, good.</p>
<p>Potter, take Weasley with you.</p>
<p>He looks far too happy over there.</p>
<p>I don't want</p>
<p>to take Potions.</p>
<p>There's Quidditch trials coming up,</p>
<p>I need to practice.</p>
<p>Attention to detail in the preparation</p>
<p>is the prerequisite of all plan.</p>
<p>Harry, my boy,</p>
<p>I've been beginning to worry.</p>
<p>You brought someone</p>
<p>with us, I see.</p>
<p>Ron Weasley, sir.</p>
<p>But I'm dead awful at Potions.</p>
<p>A menace, actually so.</p>
<p>I'm probably just gonna--</p>
<p>Nonsense,</p>
<p>we'll sort you out.</p>
<p>Any friend of Harry's</p>
<p>is a friend of mine.</p>
<p>Get your books out.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, sir, I haven't actually</p>
<p>got my book yet and nor is Ron.</p>
<p>Not to worry,</p>
<p>get what you want from the cupboard.</p>
<p>Now as I was saying,</p>
<p>I prepared some concoctions</p>
<p>this morning.</p>
<p>Any ideas</p>
<p>what these might be?</p>
<p>Yes, Miss...?</p>
<p>Granger, sir.</p>
<p>That one there is</p>
<p>Veritaserum.</p>
<p>It's a truth-telling serum.</p>
<p>And that one--</p>
<p>It's terribly tricky to make.</p>
<p>This is Amortentia.</p>
<p>The most powerful</p>
<p>love potion in the world.</p>
<p>It's rumored to smell differently</p>
<p>to each person</p>
<p>according to</p>
<p>what attracts them.</p>
<p>For example, I smell...</p>
<p>Freshly mown grass</p>
<p>and new parchment and...</p>
<p>Spearmint toothpaste.</p>
<p>Now Amortentia</p>
<p>doesn't create actual love.</p>
<p>That would be impossible,</p>
<p>but it does cause</p>
<p>powerful infatuation or obsession.</p>
<p>And for that reason,</p>
<p>it is probably the most</p>
<p>dangerous potion in this room.</p>
<p>Sir, you haven't told us</p>
<p>what's in that one.</p>
<p>Oh yes. What you see before you,</p>
<p>ladies and gentlemen,</p>
<p>is a curious little potion,</p>
<p>known as Felix Felicis.</p>
<p>But it is more commonly known</p>
<p>referred to as--</p>
<p>Liquid luck.</p>
<p>Yes, Miss Granger.</p>
<p>Liquid luck.</p>
<p>Desperately tricky to make,</p>
<p>disastrous should you get it wrong.</p>
<p>One sip and you'll find</p>
<p>that all of your endeavours succeed.</p>
<p>At least</p>
<p>until the effects wear off.</p>
<p>So this is what I offer</p>
<p>each of you today.</p>
<p>One tiny vial of liquid luck</p>
<p>to the student</p>
<p>who in the hour that remains,</p>
<p>manages to brew</p>
<p>an acceptable</p>
<p>Draught of Living Dead.</p>
<p>Recipes for which can be found</p>
<p>on page 10 of your books.</p>
<p>Issue one doubt, however.</p>
<p>Only one set of student</p>
<p>manage to brew a potion</p>
<p>of sufficient quality</p>
<p>to claim this prize.</p>
<p>Nevertheless,</p>
<p>good luck to you all.</p>
<p>Let the brewing commence.</p>
<p>How did you do that?</p>
<p>You crush it,</p>
<p>don't cut it.</p>
<p>No, the instructions</p>
<p>specifically says to cut.</p>
<p>No, really.</p>
<p>Merlin's beard!</p>
<p>It is perfect!</p>
<p>So perfect I'd just say</p>
<p>one drop would kill us all!</p>
<p>Here we are then,</p>
<p>as promised.</p>
<p>One vial of Felix Felicis.</p>
<p>Congratulations.</p>
<p>Use it well.</p>
<p>Oh Harry,</p>
<p>you got my message?</p>
<p>Come in.</p>
<p>How are you?</p>
<p>I'm fine, sir.</p>
<p>Enjoying your classes?</p>
<p>I know Professor Slughorn</p>
<p>is most impressed with you.</p>
<p>I think he overestimates</p>
<p>my abilities, sir.</p>
<p>Do you?</p>
<p>Definitely.</p>
<p>What about your activities</p>
<p>outside the classroom?</p>
<p>Sir?</p>
<p>Well, I notice you've spent</p>
<p>a great deal of time with Miss Granger.</p>
<p>I can't help wondering if--</p>
<p>Oh, no, no, I mean...</p>
<p>She's brilliant</p>
<p>and we're friends.</p>
<p>But no.</p>
<p>Forgive me.</p>
<p>I was only being curious.</p>
<p>But enough chit-chat.</p>
<p>You must be wondering</p>
<p>why I summoned you here tonight.</p>
<p>The answer lies here.</p>
<p>What you're looking at</p>
<p>are memories.</p>
<p>In this case,</p>
<p>pertaining to one individual:</p>
<p>Voldemort.</p>
<p>Or as he was known, then:</p>
<p>Tom Riddle.</p>
<p>This vial contains</p>
<p>the most sufficient memory.</p>
<p>On the day</p>
<p>I first met him.</p>
<p>I'd like you to see it.</p>
<p>If you want.</p>
<p>I'm to admit to some confusion for</p>
<p>receiving your letter, Mr. Dumbledore.</p>
<p>In all the years Tom's been here,</p>
<p>he's never once had a family visitor.</p>
<p>There have been incidents</p>
<p>with the other children--</p>
<p>Nasty things.</p>
<p>Tom, you have a visitor.</p>
<p>How'd you do, Tom?</p>
<p>Don't.</p>
<p>You're the doctor,</p>
<p>aren't you?</p>
<p>No, I'm a professor.</p>
<p>I don't believe you.</p>
<p>She wants me</p>
<p>looked at.</p>
<p>They think I'm...</p>
<p>different.</p>
<p>Or perhaps they're right.</p>
<p>I'm not mad.</p>
<p>Hogwarts is not a place</p>
<p>for mad people.</p>
<p>Hogwarts is a school.</p>
<p>School of magic.</p>
<p>You can do things,</p>
<p>can't you, Tom?</p>
<p>Things other children can't.</p>
<p>I can make things move</p>
<p>without touching them.</p>
<p>I can make animals do</p>
<p>what I want without training them.</p>
<p>I can make bad things happen</p>
<p>to people who mean to me.</p>
<p>Can make them hurt.</p>
<p>If I want.</p>
<p>Who are you?</p>
<p>Well, I'm like you, Tom.</p>
<p>I'm different.</p>
<p>Prove it.</p>
<p>I think there's something</p>
<p>in your wardrobe</p>
<p>trying to get out, Tom.</p>
<p>Thievery is not tolerated</p>
<p>at Hogwarts, Tom.</p>
<p>At Hogwarts, we'll be taught not only</p>
<p>how to use magic, but how to control it.</p>
<p>You understand me?</p>
<p>I can speak to snakes too.</p>
<p>They find me.</p>
<p>Whisper things.</p>
<p>Is that normal for someone like me?</p>
<p>Did you know, sir,</p>
<p>then?</p>
<p>Did I know I just met the most</p>
<p>dangerous dark wizard of all time?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>If I had, I...</p>
<p>Over time</p>
<p>while here at Hogwarts,</p>
<p>Tom Riddle grew close</p>
<p>to one particular teacher.</p>
<p>Can you guess</p>
<p>who that teacher might be?</p>
<p>You didn't bring Professor Slughorn back</p>
<p>simply to teach potions, did you, sir?</p>
<p>No, I did not.</p>
<p>You see, Professor Slughorn possesses</p>
<p>something that I desire very dearly.</p>
<p>He will not</p>
<p>give it out easily.</p>
<p>You said Professor Slughorn</p>
<p>would try to collect to me.</p>
<p>I did.</p>
<p>Do you want me</p>
<p>to let him?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Okay,</p>
<p>so this morning,</p>
<p>I'm gonna be putting you all</p>
<p>for a few drills</p>
<p>just to assess you</p>
<p>straight.</p>
<p>Quiet, please!</p>
<p>Shut it!</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Alright, um,</p>
<p>now then, remember,</p>
<p>just because you made</p>
<p>the team last year</p>
<p>does not guarantee you</p>
<p>a spot this year.</p>
<p>Is that clear?</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>No hard feelings, Weasley,</p>
<p>alright?</p>
<p>Hard feelings?</p>
<p>Yeah, I'll be going out</p>
<p>for Keeper's, well,</p>
<p>It's...</p>
<p>nothing personal.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Such a big guy like you?</p>
<p>You've got more of a Beater's build,</p>
<p>don't you think?</p>
<p>Keepers need</p>
<p>to be quick, agile.</p>
<p>I'll have my chances.</p>
<p>Say, um, you think you could</p>
<p>introduce me to your friend, Granger?</p>
<p>Wouldn't mind, eh,</p>
<p>getting on a first-hand base,</p>
<p>you know</p>
<p>what I mean?</p>
<p>Come on, come on.</p>
<p>Go, Cormac.</p>
<p>Come on, Ron!</p>
<p>Come on, Ron.</p>
<p>Confundus.</p>
<p>He's brilliant.</p>
<p>I have to admit I thought</p>
<p>I was going to miss that last one.</p>
<p>I hope Cormac's</p>
<p>not taking it too hard.</p>
<p>He's got a bit of a thing for you,</p>
<p>Hermione-- Cormac.</p>
<p>He's vile.</p>
<p>Have you ever heard of the spell:</p>
<p>Sectumsempra?</p>
<p>No, I haven't.</p>
<p>If you had a shred of self-respect,</p>
<p>you'd hand that book in.</p>
<p>Not bloody likely.</p>
<p>He's top of the class.</p>
<p>He's even better than you, Hermione.</p>
<p>Slughorn thinks</p>
<p>he's a genius.</p>
<p>I'd like to know</p>
<p>who's that book was.</p>
<p>Let's have a look, shall we?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Why not?</p>
<p>The binding is fragile.</p>
<p>"The binding is fragile"?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Who's the Half-Blood Prince?</p>
<p>Who?</p>
<p>That's what it says</p>
<p>right here.</p>
<p>This book is property</p>
<p>of the Half-Blood Prince.</p>
<p>For weeks,</p>
<p>you carry around this book.</p>
<p>Practically, sleep with it,</p>
<p>and yet you have no desire</p>
<p>to find out</p>
<p>who the Half-Blood Prince is.</p>
<p>I didn't say I wasn't curious</p>
<p>and I don't sleep with it.</p>
<p>Well, it's true.</p>
<p>Well, I got a nice chat</p>
<p>before I go to bed.</p>
<p>And all you do is that bloody book.</p>
<p>It's like being with Hermione.</p>
<p>Well, I was curious</p>
<p>So, I went to--</p>
<p>The library?</p>
<p>The library?</p>
<p>And?</p>
<p>And nothing.</p>
<p>I couldn't find a reference</p>
<p>anywhere</p>
<p>to the Half-Blood Prince.</p>
<p>There we go.</p>
<p>That settles it, then.</p>
<p>Yeah, uh...</p>
<p>hoping to find you</p>
<p>in the Three Broomsticks.</p>
<p>Uh no, emergency choir practice</p>
<p>from the freighthorse.</p>
<p>Does anyone fancy</p>
<p>a butterbeer?</p>
<p>A chum of mine</p>
<p>was sledging down Clagsby Hill.</p>
<p>We had a very long, home-made</p>
<p>Norwegian style sledge.</p>
<p>We hurtled down,</p>
<p>we hit what most...</p>
<p>Ron, sit aside me.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Something to drink?</p>
<p>Three butterbeers</p>
<p>and some ginger in mine, please.</p>
<p>Oh, bloody hell.</p>
<p>Ron, see they're only</p>
<p>holding hands.</p>
<p>And snogging.</p>
<p>I'd like to leave.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>You can't be serious.</p>
<p>That happens to be my sister.</p>
<p>So?</p>
<p>What if she looked at me</p>
<p>and saw you snogging me?</p>
<p>Would you expect her</p>
<p>to get up and leave?</p>
<p>Hey, my boy.</p>
<p>So wonderful to see you.</p>
<p>And you, and you.</p>
<p>So what brings you here?</p>
<p>Oh, Three Broomsticks and I go way back</p>
<p>further than I care to admit.</p>
<p>I could remember</p>
<p>when it was One Broomstick.</p>
<p>All hands on deck, Granger.</p>
<p>Listen, my boy,</p>
<p>in the old days, I used to throw together</p>
<p>the occassional supper party.</p>
<p>Select a student</p>
<p>or two.</p>
<p>Would you be game?</p>
<p>I consider it</p>
<p>an honor, sir.</p>
<p>You'd be welcome too,</p>
<p>Granger.</p>
<p>I'd be delighted, sir.</p>
<p>Splendid!</p>
<p>Look for my owl.</p>
<p>Good to see you, Wallenby.</p>
<p>What are you playing at?</p>
<p>Dumbledore's asked me</p>
<p>to get to know him.</p>
<p>Get to know him?</p>
<p>Dunno.</p>
<p>It must be important.</p>
<p>If it wasn't,</p>
<p>Dumbledore wouldn't ask.</p>
<p>You got a little bit...</p>
<p>Katie, we don't know</p>
<p>what it could be.</p>
<p>Harry, what...</p>
<p>I know what I'm doing.</p>
<p>Did you hear</p>
<p>what she was saying</p>
<p>back in the pub there</p>
<p>on me and her snogging?</p>
<p>I warned her.</p>
<p>I warned her not to touch it.</p>
<p>Don't get any closer!</p>
<p>Get back, all of you.</p>
<p>Oh no, no, no.</p>
<p>Do not touch that,</p>
<p>except for the wrappings.</p>
<p>Do you understand?</p>
<p>You're sure Katie did not have this</p>
<p>in her possession</p>
<p>when she entered</p>
<p>the Three Broomsticks?</p>
<p>It's like I said.</p>
<p>She left to go to the loo.</p>
<p>And when she came back,</p>
<p>she had the package.</p>
<p>She said it was important</p>
<p>that she deliver it.</p>
<p>Did she say to whom?</p>
<p>To Professor Dumbledore.</p>
<p>Very well. Thank you, Leanne.</p>
<p>You may go.</p>
<p>Why is it</p>
<p>when something happens,</p>
<p>it is always you three?</p>
<p>Believe me, Professor,</p>
<p>I've been asking myself</p>
<p>the same question for six years.</p>
<p>Oh, Severus.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>I think Ms. Bell</p>
<p>is lucky to be alive.</p>
<p>She was cursed,</p>
<p>wasn't she?</p>
<p>I know Katie.</p>
<p>Off the Quidditch pitch,</p>
<p>she wouldn't hurt a fly.</p>
<p>If she was delivering that</p>
<p>to Professor Dumbledore,</p>
<p>she wasn't doing it</p>
<p>knowingly.</p>
<p>Yes, she was cursed.</p>
<p>It was Malfoy.</p>
<p>That is a very</p>
<p>serious accusation, Potter.</p>
<p>Indeed.</p>
<p>Your evidence?</p>
<p>I just know.</p>
<p>You "just" know.</p>
<p>Once again, you're astonished</p>
<p>with your gifts, Potter.</p>
<p>Gifts mere mortals can only</p>
<p>dream of possessing.</p>
<p>How grand it must be</p>
<p>to be the Chosen One.</p>
<p>I suggest you go back</p>
<p>to your dormitories.</p>
<p>All of you.</p>
<p>What do you suppose</p>
<p>Dean sees in her-- Ginny?</p>
<p>And what does</p>
<p>she see in him?</p>
<p>Dean--</p>
<p>He's brilliant.</p>
<p>You called him slick git</p>
<p>not five hours ago.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, he was running</p>
<p>his hands all over my sister,</p>
<p>wasn't he?</p>
<p>Something snaps.</p>
<p>You've got to hate him, you know?</p>
<p>Old principle.</p>
<p>I suppose.</p>
<p>So what do you think</p>
<p>he sees in her?</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>She's smart,</p>
<p>funny, attractive--</p>
<p>Attractive?</p>
<p>You know,</p>
<p>she's got nice skin.</p>
<p>Skin? You're saying Dean's</p>
<p>dating my sister because of her skin?</p>
<p>For blood, I mean.</p>
<p>I'm just--I'm just saying</p>
<p>it could be</p>
<p>a contributing factor.</p>
<p>Hermione's got nice skin.</p>
<p>When you say it,</p>
<p>as skin goes, I mean.</p>
<p>I've never really</p>
<p>thought about it.</p>
<p>But I suppose, yeah.</p>
<p>Very nice.</p>
<p>I think</p>
<p>I'll be going to sleep now.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So tell me, Cormac, do you see anything</p>
<p>of your uncle Tiberius these days?</p>
<p>Yes, sir, in fact I'm meant</p>
<p>to get hunting with him</p>
<p>and the Minister of Magic</p>
<p>over the holidays.</p>
<p>Oh, well, be sure</p>
<p>to give them both my best.</p>
<p>And what about</p>
<p>your uncle, Belby?</p>
<p>For those of you</p>
<p>who don't know well,</p>
<p>Marcus' uncle invented</p>
<p>the Wolfsbane Potion.</p>
<p>Is he working</p>
<p>on anything new?</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>He and my dad</p>
<p>don't get along.</p>
<p>'Prolly cause my dad</p>
<p>says potions are rubbish.</p>
<p>His only potion worth having</p>
<p>is a stiff one at the end of the day.</p>
<p>And what about you,</p>
<p>Ms. Granger,</p>
<p>what exactly does your family do</p>
<p>in the Muggle world?</p>
<p>My parents are dentists.</p>
<p>They attend to people's teeth.</p>
<p>Fascinating.</p>
<p>And is that considered</p>
<p>a dangerous profession?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Although, one boy, Robby Fenwich,</p>
<p>did bite my father once.</p>
<p>He needed ten stitches.</p>
<p>Ah, Ms. Weasley.</p>
<p>Come in, come in.</p>
<p>Look, her eyes.</p>
<p>They've been fighting again.</p>
<p>Her and Dean.</p>
<p>Sorry,</p>
<p>I'm not usually late.</p>
<p>No matter,</p>
<p>just in time for dessert.</p>
<p>That is if Belby</p>
<p>has left you any.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>Goodbye.</p>
<p>Bye-bye.</p>
<p>Potter!</p>
<p>I'm sorry, sir, I was</p>
<p>just admiring your hourglass.</p>
<p>Ah yes,</p>
<p>most intriguing object.</p>
<p>The sand runs in accordance</p>
<p>with the quality of the conversation.</p>
<p>It is stimulating,</p>
<p>the sand runs slowly.</p>
<p>If it is not...</p>
<p>I think I'll be going, then.</p>
<p>Nonsense.</p>
<p>You have nothing</p>
<p>to fear, dear boy.</p>
<p>Actually,</p>
<p>some of your classmates...</p>
<p>Well, let's just say</p>
<p>they're unlikely to make the shelf.</p>
<p>Shelf, sir?</p>
<p>Anyone who aspires to be anyone</p>
<p>hopes to end up here.</p>
<p>But then again, you already</p>
<p>are someone, aren't you, Harry?</p>
<p>Did Voldemort</p>
<p>ever make the shelf, sir?</p>
<p>You knew him, didn't you, sir?</p>
<p>Tom Riddle?</p>
<p>You were his teacher.</p>
<p>Mr. Riddle had a number of teachers</p>
<p>who was here at Hogwarts.</p>
<p>What was he like?</p>
<p>I'm sorry, sir.</p>
<p>Forgive me.</p>
<p>He killed my parents.</p>
<p>Of course, it's only natural</p>
<p>you should want to know more.</p>
<p>But I'm afraid</p>
<p>I must disappoint you, Harry.</p>
<p>When I first met</p>
<p>young Mr. Riddle,</p>
<p>he was a quiet,</p>
<p>albeit brilliant boy,</p>
<p>committed to becoming</p>
<p>a first-grade wizard.</p>
<p>Not unlike</p>
<p>others I've known.</p>
<p>Not unlike yourself,</p>
<p>in fact.</p>
<p>If the monster existed,</p>
<p>it was very deep within.</p>
<p>You okay, Ron?</p>
<p>I'm counting on you, Ron.</p>
<p>I've 2 games on Gryffindor, ya?</p>
<p>Be good, Ron.</p>
<p>Loser!</p>
<p>What's he wearing?</p>
<p>So how was it, then?</p>
<p>How is what?</p>
<p>Your dinner party?</p>
<p>Pretty boring actually.</p>
<p>But I think</p>
<p>Harry enjoyed dessert.</p>
<p>Slughorn's having Christmas,</p>
<p>do you know?</p>
<p>I'm about to bring someone.</p>
<p>I expect</p>
<p>you'll be bringing McLaggen.</p>
<p>He's in the Slug Club,</p>
<p>isn't he?</p>
<p>Actually,</p>
<p>I was going to ask you.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Good luck today, Ron.</p>
<p>I know</p>
<p>you'll be brilliant.</p>
<p>I'm resigning.</p>
<p>After today's match,</p>
<p>McLaggen can have my spot.</p>
<p>Are you alright?</p>
<p>Juice?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Hello, everyone.</p>
<p>You look dreadful, Ron.</p>
<p>Is that why you put</p>
<p>something in his cup?</p>
<p>Is it a tonic?</p>
<p>Liquid luck.</p>
<p>Don't drink it, Ron.</p>
<p>You could be expelled for that.</p>
<p>What are we talking about?</p>
<p>Come on, Harry,</p>
<p>we've got a game to win.</p>
<p>Weasley! Weasley! Weasley!</p>
<p>Weasley! Weasley! Weasley!</p>
<p>You shouldn't</p>
<p>have done it.</p>
<p>I know. I supposed I could have just</p>
<p>used the Confundus charm.</p>
<p>That was different.</p>
<p>That was try-outs,</p>
<p>this was a natural game.</p>
<p>You didn't put in?</p>
<p>Ron only thought</p>
<p>you did.</p>
<p>Charm spell.</p>
<p>Just practising.</p>
<p>Very good.</p>
<p>How does it feel, Harry?</p>
<p>When you see</p>
<p>Dean with Ginny?</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>I see the way</p>
<p>you look at her.</p>
<p>You're my best friend.</p>
<p>Oops! I think</p>
<p>this room's taken.</p>
<p>What's with the birds?</p>
<p>Oppugno.</p>
<p>It feels like this.</p>
<p>I can't help it if</p>
<p>she's got her knickers in a twist.</p>
<p>What Lav and I have, well,</p>
<p>let's just say,</p>
<p>there's no stopping it.</p>
<p>It's chemical.</p>
<p>Will it last?</p>
<p>Who knows?</p>
<p>Point is</p>
<p>I'm a free agent.</p>
<p>He's at perfect liberty</p>
<p>to kiss whomever he likes.</p>
<p>I really couldn't</p>
<p>care less.</p>
<p>Was I</p>
<p>under the impression</p>
<p>he and I would be attending</p>
<p>Slughorn's Christmas party together?</p>
<p>Yes. Now,</p>
<p>given the circumstances,</p>
<p>I had to make</p>
<p>other arrangements.</p>
<p>Have you?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Well, I just thought</p>
<p>seeing is not the risk at going</p>
<p>with who</p>
<p>we'd really like to,</p>
<p>We should go together,</p>
<p>as friends.</p>
<p>Why didn't</p>
<p>I think of that?</p>
<p>Who are you going with?</p>
<p>Um, it's a surprise.</p>
<p>Anyways, you have got to worry about.</p>
<p>You can't take anyone.</p>
<p>You see that girl</p>
<p>over there?</p>
<p>That's Romilda Vane.</p>
<p>Harry, she's been been trying</p>
<p>to smuggle you a love potion.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Hey!</p>
<p>She's only interested in you because</p>
<p>she thinks you're the Chosen One.</p>
<p>But I am</p>
<p>the Chosen One.</p>
<p>Okay, sorry, um...</p>
<p>Kidding.</p>
<p>I'll ask someone I like.</p>
<p>Someone cool.</p>
<p>I've never been</p>
<p>to this part of the castle.</p>
<p>At least,</p>
<p>not while awake.</p>
<p>I sleep-walk, you see.</p>
<p>That's why</p>
<p>I wear shoes to bed.</p>
<p>Harmonia nictere passus.</p>
<p>Harmonia nictere passus.</p>
<p>Harmonia nictere passus.</p>
<p>Drink?</p>
<p>Neville.</p>
<p>I didn't get</p>
<p>into the Slug Club.</p>
<p>It's okay, though.</p>
<p>He's got Melvin hanging up</p>
<p>towels in the looroom.</p>
<p>I'm--I'm fine, mate.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Hermione,</p>
<p>what are you doing?</p>
<p>What happened to you?</p>
<p>No, I've just escaped.</p>
<p>I mean, I left Cormac</p>
<p>under the mistletoe.</p>
<p>Cormac?</p>
<p>That's who you invited?</p>
<p>I thought it would</p>
<p>annoy Ron the most.</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
<p>We will catch up with you.</p>
<p>He's got more tentacles</p>
<p>than a Snargaluff plant.</p>
<p>Dragon tails?</p>
<p>No, I'm fine, thank you.</p>
<p>Just this one.</p>
<p>They give one horribly bad breath.</p>
<p>On second thoughts,</p>
<p>it might keep Cormac away.</p>
<p>God, here he comes.</p>
<p>I think she just went</p>
<p>to paddle her nose.</p>
<p>She's a little minx,</p>
<p>your friend.</p>
<p>Nice to work.</p>
<p>How nasty isn't she?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah,</p>
<p>yeah.</p>
<p>What is this I'm eating,</p>
<p>by the way?</p>
<p>Dragon balls.</p>
<p>You've just brought yourself</p>
<p>a month's detention, McLaggen.</p>
<p>Not so quick, Potter.</p>
<p>Sir, I really think I should</p>
<p>rejoin the party. My date--</p>
<p>Can surely survive your absence</p>
<p>for another minute or two.</p>
<p>Besides, I only wish</p>
<p>to convey a message.</p>
<p>Message?</p>
<p>From Professor Dumbledore.</p>
<p>He asked me to give you his best</p>
<p>and he hopes you enjoy your holidays.</p>
<p>He...</p>
<p>He's travelling.</p>
<p>And he won't return</p>
<p>until term resumes.</p>
<p>Travelling where?</p>
<p>How are you?</p>
<p>Get your hands off me,</p>
<p>you filthy Squibb.</p>
<p>Professor Slughorn, sir.</p>
<p>I just discovered this boy</p>
<p>lurking in an upstairs corridor.</p>
<p>He claims to have been</p>
<p>invited to your party.</p>
<p>Okay, okay,</p>
<p>I was gate-crashing.</p>
<p>Happy?</p>
<p>I'll escort him out.</p>
<p>Certainly, Professor.</p>
<p>Alright, everyone carry on,</p>
<p>carry on.</p>
<p>Maybe I did hex that Bell girl.</p>
<p>Maybe I didn't.</p>
<p>What about you?</p>
<p>I swore to protect you.</p>
<p>I made the Unbreakable Vow.</p>
<p>I don't need protection.</p>
<p>I was chosen</p>
<p>for this.</p>
<p>I don't know</p>
<p>what all this mean,</p>
<p>but I won't fail him.</p>
<p>You're afraid, Draco.</p>
<p>You attempt to consider,</p>
<p>but it's obvious,</p>
<p>let me assist you.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I was chosen.</p>
<p>This is my moment.</p>
<p>Unbreakable Vow.</p>
<p>You sure that's what Snape said?</p>
<p>Positive. Why?</p>
<p>It's just, you can't break</p>
<p>an Unbreakable Vow.</p>
<p>I-I worked that much out</p>
<p>for myself, funny enough.</p>
<p>I don't understand.</p>
<p>Oh bloody hell.</p>
<p>I miss you.</p>
<p>Lovely.</p>
<p>All she wants to do</p>
<p>is snog me.</p>
<p>My lips</p>
<p>are getting chapped, look.</p>
<p>Then I'll take</p>
<p>your word for it.</p>
<p>So what happens</p>
<p>to you?</p>
<p>What happens</p>
<p>if you break an Unbreakable Vow?</p>
<p>You die.</p>
<p>Voldemort has chosen</p>
<p>Draco Malfoy for a mission?</p>
<p>I know it sounds mad.</p>
<p>Has it occured to you, Harry,</p>
<p>that Snape was simply pretending</p>
<p>to offer Draco help</p>
<p>so he could find out</p>
<p>what he was up to?</p>
<p>Ginny!</p>
<p>That's not</p>
<p>what it sounded like.</p>
<p>Perhaps Harry</p>
<p>is right, Remus.</p>
<p>I mean, to make</p>
<p>an Unbreakable Vow--</p>
<p>It comes down to whether or not</p>
<p>you trust Dumbledore's judgement.</p>
<p>Dumbledore trusts Snape,</p>
<p>therefore, I do.</p>
<p>Dumbledore</p>
<p>can make mistakes.</p>
<p>He said so himself.</p>
<p>You are blinded by hatred.</p>
<p>I'm not.</p>
<p>Yes, you are.</p>
<p>People are disappearing,</p>
<p>Harry. Daily.</p>
<p>We could only place our trust</p>
<p>in a handful of people.</p>
<p>If we started fighting</p>
<p>amongst ourselves,</p>
<p>we're doomed.</p>
<p>Ginny!</p>
<p>Open up, you.</p>
<p>Don't you trust me?</p>
<p>It's good.</p>
<p>Just, uh, get...</p>
<p>Pie?</p>
<p>Not for me. No.</p>
<p>You'll have to forgive</p>
<p>Remus.</p>
<p>It takes its toll,</p>
<p>his condition.</p>
<p>Are you alright,</p>
<p>Mr. Weasley?</p>
<p>We're being followed,</p>
<p>all of us.</p>
<p>Most days, Molly doesn't</p>
<p>leave the house.</p>
<p>It's not been easy.</p>
<p>Did you get my owl?</p>
<p>Yes, I did.</p>
<p>If Dumbledore is traveling,</p>
<p>then perhaps news to the Ministry,</p>
<p>but perhaps that's the way</p>
<p>Dumbledore wants it.</p>
<p>As for Draco Malfoy...</p>
<p>I know a bit more.</p>
<p>Go on.</p>
<p>I sent an agent to Borgin and Burkes.</p>
<p>I think from</p>
<p>what you described...</p>
<p>What you and Ron</p>
<p>saw at the end of summer,</p>
<p>the object that Draco</p>
<p>is so interested in,</p>
<p>is a Vanishing Cabinet.</p>
<p>A "Vanishing Cabinet"?</p>
<p>They were all the rage</p>
<p>when Voldemort first rose to power.</p>
<p>You can see the appeal.</p>
<p>Should the Death Eaters</p>
<p>come knocking,</p>
<p>one simply have to slip inside</p>
<p>and disappear for an hour or two.</p>
<p>It transports you</p>
<p>practically anywhere.</p>
<p>Tricky contraptions, though.</p>
<p>Very temperamental.</p>
<p>What happened to it?</p>
<p>The one</p>
<p>at Borgin and Burkes?</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>It's still there.</p>
<p>It was delicious,</p>
<p>Molly, really.</p>
<p>Are you sure</p>
<p>you won't stay?</p>
<p>No, we should go.</p>
<p>The first night of the cycle's</p>
<p>always the worst.</p>
<p>Remus?</p>
<p>Sweetheart.</p>
<p>Has Ron</p>
<p>gone to bed?</p>
<p>Um, not yet. No.</p>
<p>Shoelace...</p>
<p>Merry Christmas, Harry.</p>
<p>Merry Christmas.</p>
<p>Harry, no!</p>
<p>Harry! Remus.</p>
<p>Ginny!</p>
<p>I killed Sirius Black!</p>
<p>I killed Sirius Black!</p>
<p>You coming to get me?</p>
<p>Get me!</p>
<p>He's trying to get me!</p>
<p>Harry?</p>
<p>Stupefy!</p>
<p>Harry!</p>
<p>Ginny!</p>
<p>Molly.</p>
<p>It's so easy for them</p>
<p>to get to you.</p>
<p>You're bloody lucky</p>
<p>you weren't killed.</p>
<p>You have to realise</p>
<p>who you are, Harry!</p>
<p>I know who I am,</p>
<p>Hermione, alright.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>Hon, go somewhere.</p>
<p>That's my Won-Won.</p>
<p>Excuse me,</p>
<p>I have to go and vomit.</p>
<p>...Always you ruin</p>
<p>half the start.</p>
<p>Sir, is it true that</p>
<p>Professor Merrythought is retiring?</p>
<p>Tom, I couldn't tell you</p>
<p>if I knew, could I?</p>
<p>And by the way,</p>
<p>thank you for the pineapple.</p>
<p>You're quite right.</p>
<p>It is my favorite.</p>
<p>But how did you know?</p>
<p>Intuition.</p>
<p>Good gracious,</p>
<p>is it that time already?</p>
<p>Off you go, boys, or Professor Dippett</p>
<p>will have us all in detention.</p>
<p>Look sharp, Tom.</p>
<p>Don't be caught</p>
<p>out of bed after hours.</p>
<p>Is something</p>
<p>on your mind, Tom?</p>
<p>Yes, sir.</p>
<p>See, I couldn�t think of</p>
<p>anyone else to go to.</p>
<p>The other professors...</p>
<p>Well, they're not like you.</p>
<p>They might</p>
<p>misunderstand.</p>
<p>Go on.</p>
<p>I was in the library</p>
<p>the other night.</p>
<p>In the restricted section.</p>
<p>And I picked something</p>
<p>rather odd about this rare magic.</p>
<p>I thought perhaps, you could illuminate me.</p>
<p>It's called, as I understand it, Hor...</p>
<p>I beg your pardon?</p>
<p>I don't know anything about such things and if I did, I wouldn't tell you. Now get out of here at once and don't let me ever catch you mentioning them again!</p>
<p></p><p></p>
<p>Confused?</p>
<p>I'd be surprised if you weren't.</p>
<p>I don't understand.</p>
<p>What happened?</p>
<p>This is perhaps the most important memory I had collected.</p>
<p>It is also a lie.</p>
<p>This memory has been tempered with</p>
<p>by the same person whose memory it is.</p>
<p>Our old friend,</p>
<p>Professor Slughorn.</p>
<p>But why would he temper</p>
<p>with his own memory?</p>
<p>I suspect</p>
<p>he's ashamed of it.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Why, indeed.</p>
<p>I asked you to get to know</p>
<p>Professor Slughorn</p>
<p>and you had done so.</p>
<p>Now I want you to persuade him</p>
<p>to divulge his true memory.</p>
<p>Any way you can.</p>
<p>I don't know him</p>
<p>that well, sir.</p>
<p>This memory is everything.</p>
<p>Without it, we are blind.</p>
<p>Without it, we leave</p>
<p>the fate of our world to chance.</p>
<p>You have no choice.</p>
<p>You must not fail.</p>
<p>I highly recommend,</p>
<p>reacquaint yourself</p>
<p>with the chapter</p>
<p>on antidotes.</p>
<p>Now, I'll tell you more about</p>
<p>bezoars in our next class.</p>
<p>Right, off you go.</p>
<p>Elise, don't forget your rat tail.</p>
<p>Aha! It isn't</p>
<p>the Prince of Potions himself!</p>
<p>What do I owe</p>
<p>this pleasure?</p>
<p>Oh, sir, I wondered</p>
<p>if I wanted to ask you something.</p>
<p>Ask away, dear boy.</p>
<p>Ask away.</p>
<p>Well, you see the other day,</p>
<p>I was in the library</p>
<p>in the restricted section,</p>
<p>and I came across something</p>
<p>rather odd</p>
<p>about a very rare piece of magic.</p>
<p>Yes, what was</p>
<p>this rare piece of magic?</p>
<p>Well, I don't know,</p>
<p>but I can't remember the name exactly.</p>
<p>But it just got me wondering,</p>
<p>are there some kinds of magic</p>
<p>you're not allowed</p>
<p>to teach us?</p>
<p>I'm Potions Master,</p>
<p>Harry,</p>
<p>I think your question better be</p>
<p>posed to Professor Snape.</p>
<p>Yes, he and I don't</p>
<p>exactly see eye-to-eye, sir.</p>
<p>What I mean</p>
<p>to say is...</p>
<p>Well, he's not like you.</p>
<p>He might misunderstand.</p>
<p>Yes, it would be no light</p>
<p>without the dark.</p>
<p>And so</p>
<p>it is with magic,</p>
<p>myself I always strive</p>
<p>to live within the light.</p>
<p>I suggest</p>
<p>you do the same.</p>
<p>Is that what you told Tom Riddle, sir,</p>
<p>when he came asking questions?</p>
<p>Dumbledore put you up to this,</p>
<p>didn't he?</p>
<p>Didn't he?</p>
<p>Yes?</p>
<p>Oh, it's you, Potter.</p>
<p>I-I'm sorry,</p>
<p>I'm busy at the moment.</p>
<p>That's beautiful,</p>
<p>isn't it?</p>
<p>The moon.</p>
<p>Divine.</p>
<p>Had ourselves a little</p>
<p>late night snack, did we?</p>
<p>It was on your bed, the box.</p>
<p>I just thought I'd try one.</p>
<p>Or twenty?</p>
<p>I can't stop</p>
<p>thinking about her, Harry.</p>
<p>Honestly, you know, I reckon</p>
<p>she was starting to annoy you.</p>
<p>She could never annoy me.</p>
<p>I think I love her.</p>
<p>Well, brilliant.</p>
<p>Do you think</p>
<p>she knows I exist?</p>
<p>I very well hope so.</p>
<p>She's been snogging you</p>
<p>for three months.</p>
<p>Snogging?</p>
<p>Who are you talking about?</p>
<p>Who are you talking about?</p>
<p>Romilda, of course.</p>
<p>Romilda Vane.</p>
<p>Okay, very funny.</p>
<p>What was that for?</p>
<p>It's no joke.</p>
<p>I'm in love with her!</p>
<p>Alright, fine.</p>
<p>You're in love with her.</p>
<p>Have you ever actually met her?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Can you introduce me?</p>
<p>Come on, Ron.</p>
<p>I will introduce you to Romilda Vane.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, sir.</p>
<p>I wouldn't bother you</p>
<p>if it weren't absolutely essential.</p>
<p>Where's Romilda?</p>
<p>What's the matter with Wimby?</p>
<p>Very powerful love potion.</p>
<p>Very well,</p>
<p>better bring him in.</p>
<p>I always thought you could whip up</p>
<p>a remedy for this is in no time, Harry.</p>
<p>Well, I-I thought this called</p>
<p>for more practised hands, sir.</p>
<p>Hello, darling.</p>
<p>Fancy a drink?</p>
<p>Perhaps, you're right.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, by the way, Professor,</p>
<p>about earlier today.</p>
<p>Our misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Oh, not at all.</p>
<p>Old water under the bridge, you know.</p>
<p>Correct?</p>
<p>Well, I expect you're tired a bit,</p>
<p>after all these years.</p>
<p>And the questions</p>
<p>about Voldemort.</p>
<p>Don't use that name!</p>
<p>Here you go, boy.</p>
<p>Bottom's up.</p>
<p>What's this?</p>
<p>Tonic for the nerves.</p>
<p>What happened to me?</p>
<p>A love potion.</p>
<p>A bloody strong one at there.</p>
<p>I feel really bad.</p>
<p>You need to pick me up, my boy.</p>
<p>Got butterbeer, wine,</p>
<p>dazzling oak-matured mead.</p>
<p>I had other intentions for this,</p>
<p>but I think, given the circumstances.</p>
<p>Here you are, Potter.</p>
<p>To life!</p>
<p>Ron!</p>
<p>Ron!</p>
<p>Professor, do something.</p>
<p>I-I don't understand!</p>
<p>Come on, Ron,</p>
<p>breathe!</p>
<p>These girls...</p>
<p>They're gonna kill me.</p>
<p>Quick thinking on your part,</p>
<p>Harry, using a bezoar.</p>
<p>You should be very proud</p>
<p>of your student, Horace.</p>
<p>Ah, yes.</p>
<p>Very proud.</p>
<p>I think we agree</p>
<p>Potter's actions were heroic.</p>
<p>The question is:</p>
<p>Why were they necessary?</p>
<p>I, indeed.</p>
<p>This appears to be a gift,</p>
<p>Horace.</p>
<p>You don't remember</p>
<p>who gave you this bottle?</p>
<p>By the way,</p>
<p>it possesses remarkably</p>
<p>subtle hints</p>
<p>of liquorice and cherry.</p>
<p>When not polluted</p>
<p>with poison.</p>
<p>Actually, I had intended</p>
<p>to give it as a gift, myself.</p>
<p>To whom,</p>
<p>might I ask?</p>
<p>To you, headmaster.</p>
<p>Where is he?</p>
<p>Where's my Won-Won?</p>
<p>Has he been</p>
<p>asking for me?</p>
<p>What's she doing here?</p>
<p>I might ask you</p>
<p>the same question.</p>
<p>I happen to be</p>
<p>his girlfriend.</p>
<p>And I happen to be his...</p>
<p>friend.</p>
<p>Don't make me laugh.</p>
<p>You haven't spoken</p>
<p>in weeks.</p>
<p>I suppose you want</p>
<p>to make up with him</p>
<p>now that he's suddenly</p>
<p>all interesting.</p>
<p>He's been poisoned,</p>
<p>you daft dimbo!</p>
<p>And for the record,</p>
<p>I've always found him interesting.</p>
<p>See?</p>
<p>He senses my presence.</p>
<p>Don't worry, Won-Won.</p>
<p>I'm here.</p>
<p>I'm here.</p>
<p>Hermione.</p>
<p>Hermione.</p>
<p>Hermione.</p>
<p>Oh to be young</p>
<p>and to feel love's keen sting.</p>
<p>Well, come over,</p>
<p>everybody.</p>
<p>Mr. Weasley's well attended.</p>
<p>About time,</p>
<p>don't you think?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Just shut up.</p>
<p>Stop it, Ron.</p>
<p>You're making it snow.</p>
<p>Tell me how I broke up</p>
<p>with Lavender again.</p>
<p>Well, she came to visit you</p>
<p>in the hospital.</p>
<p>And you talked.</p>
<p>I don't believe it was</p>
<p>a particularly long conversation.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong.</p>
<p>I'm bloody thrilled to be shot of her's.</p>
<p>She seems a bit...</p>
<p>put out.</p>
<p>Yes, um...</p>
<p>She does, isn't she?</p>
<p>You say you don't remember</p>
<p>anything from that night.</p>
<p>Anything at all?</p>
<p>There is something.</p>
<p>It can't be.</p>
<p>I was completely boggled,</p>
<p>didn't I?</p>
<p>Boggled.</p>
<p>Harry...</p>
<p>That's Katie.</p>
<p>Katie Bell.</p>
<p>Katie,</p>
<p>how are you?</p>
<p>I know you're going</p>
<p>to ask, Harry.</p>
<p>But I don't know</p>
<p>who cursed me.</p>
<p>I've been trying</p>
<p>to remember. Honestly.</p>
<p>But I just can't.</p>
<p>Katie.</p>
<p>I know what you did,</p>
<p>Malfoy.</p>
<p>You hexed it,</p>
<p>didn't you?</p>
<p>Sectumsempra!</p>
<p>You have</p>
<p>to get rid of it.</p>
<p>Today.</p>
<p>Take my hand.</p>
<p>It's the Room of Requirement.</p>
<p>We need to hide</p>
<p>the Half-Blood Prince's book.</p>
<p>Where no one'll ever find it.</p>
<p>Including you.</p>
<p>What was that?</p>
<p>What was that?</p>
<p>See, you never know</p>
<p>what you'll find up here.</p>
<p>Alright, close your eyes.</p>
<p>That way you can't be tempted.</p>
<p>Close your eyes.</p>
<p>S u B:</p>
<p>V e R d i K </p>
<p>That can stay hidden</p>
<p>up here too if you like.</p>
<p>So, did you and Ginny</p>
<p>do it then?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Well, hide the book?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, g--</p>
<p>Still no luck with Slughorn then,</p>
<p>I take it?</p>
<p>Luck.</p>
<p>That's it.</p>
<p>All I need is a bit of luck.</p>
<p>Well, how do you feel?</p>
<p>Excellent.</p>
<p>Really excellent.</p>
<p>Remember, Slughorn usually</p>
<p>leaves early, takes a walk,</p>
<p>and then</p>
<p>returns to his office.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I'm going down to Hagrid's.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>No, Harry, you've got</p>
<p>to go to speak to Slughorn.</p>
<p>We have a plan.</p>
<p>I know but I've got a really</p>
<p>good feeling about Hagrid's.</p>
<p>I feel it's--it's</p>
<p>the place to be tonight.</p>
<p>Do you know</p>
<p>what I mean?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Well, trust me.</p>
<p>I know what I'm doing.</p>
<p>Or Felix does.</p>
<p>Hi!</p>
<p>Merlin's beard, Harry!</p>
<p>Sorry, sir.</p>
<p>I should have announced myself.</p>
<p>Clear my throat.</p>
<p>Coughed.</p>
<p>You probably thought</p>
<p>I was Professor Sprout?</p>
<p>Definitely.</p>
<p>What makes you think?</p>
<p>Ah well,</p>
<p>just your general behaviour, sir.</p>
<p>Just sneaking around,</p>
<p>jumping when you saw me.</p>
<p>Are those tentacular leaves, sir?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>They're very valuable,</p>
<p>aren't they?</p>
<p>Ten galleons a leaf</p>
<p>to the right buyer.</p>
<p>Not that I'm familiar with</p>
<p>any such back alley transactions</p>
<p>but one does hear rumours.</p>
<p>My only interests</p>
<p>are purely academical.</p>
<p>I mean, personally,</p>
<p>these plants always kinda freak me out.</p>
<p>Exactly how did you get</p>
<p>out of the castle, Harry?</p>
<p>Through the front door, sir.</p>
<p>I'm off to Hagrid's, you see.</p>
<p>He's a very dear friend</p>
<p>and I just fancy paying him a visit.</p>
<p>So if you don't mind,</p>
<p>I will be going now.</p>
<p>Harry!</p>
<p>Sir?</p>
<p>It's nearly nightfall.</p>
<p>Surely, you realise</p>
<p>I can't allow you to go</p>
<p>roaming the grounds</p>
<p>by yourself.</p>
<p>Well then, by all means,</p>
<p>come along, sir.</p>
<p>Harry, I must insist you</p>
<p>accompany me</p>
<p>back to the castle</p>
<p>immediately!</p>
<p>That would</p>
<p>be counterproductive, sir.</p>
<p>And what makes</p>
<p>you say that?</p>
<p>No idea.</p>
<p>Horace.</p>
<p>Merlin's beard!</p>
<p>Is that an actual Acromantula?</p>
<p>A dead one,</p>
<p>I think, sir.</p>
<p>Good God.</p>
<p>Dear fellow, however</p>
<p>did you manage to kill it?</p>
<p>"Kill it"?</p>
<p>My oldest friend,</p>
<p>he was.</p>
<p>I'm so sorry,</p>
<p>I didn't--</p>
<p>Ah, don't worry yourself.</p>
<p>You're not alone.</p>
<p>Seriously misunderstood creatures,</p>
<p>spiders are.</p>
<p>The eyes I reckon,</p>
<p>they unnerve some folk.</p>
<p>Not to mention</p>
<p>the pincers.</p>
<p>Yeah,</p>
<p>I reckon that too.</p>
<p>Hagrid...</p>
<p>The last thing</p>
<p>I wish to be is indelicate</p>
<p>but Acromantula venom</p>
<p>is uncommonly rare.</p>
<p>Would you allow me</p>
<p>to extract a vial or two,</p>
<p>purely for academic purposes,</p>
<p>you understand?</p>
<p>Well I don't suppose it's gonna do him</p>
<p>much good now is it.</p>
<p>My thoughts exactly.</p>
<p>I have a ampoule or two about my person</p>
<p>for just such occassions as this.</p>
<p>Old... Potion master's habit,</p>
<p>you know?</p>
<p>I wish you could have</p>
<p>seen him with his prime.</p>
<p>Magnificent, he was.</p>
<p>Just magnificent.</p>
<p>Would you like me</p>
<p>to say a few words?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Had a family, I trust?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Farewell...</p>
<p>Aragog.</p>
<p>Farewell, Aragog.</p>
<p>King of the arachnids.</p>
<p>Your body will decay...</p>
<p>but your spirit lingers on</p>
<p>and your human friends</p>
<p>find solace,</p>
<p>the loss</p>
<p>they have sustained.</p>
<p># Laid to rest, #</p>
<p># And his wand,</p>
<p>snapped in two, #</p>
<p># Which was sad, #</p>
<p>I had him from an egg,</p>
<p>you know?</p>
<p>Tiny little thing he was</p>
<p>when he hatched.</p>
<p>No bigger</p>
<p>than a Pekingese.</p>
<p>A Pekingese, mind you.</p>
<p>How sweet!</p>
<p>I once had a fish.</p>
<p>Francis.</p>
<p>He was very dear to me.</p>
<p>One afternoon,</p>
<p>I came downstairs and...</p>
<p>it vanished.</p>
<p>Poof.</p>
<p>That's very odd,</p>
<p>isn't it?</p>
<p>Yes, doesn't it?</p>
<p>But that's life!</p>
<p>I suppose,</p>
<p>you--you go along with</p>
<p>and suddenly...</p>
<p>poof.</p>
<p>Poof.</p>
<p>Poof.</p>
<p>It was a student</p>
<p>who gave me Francis.</p>
<p>One spring afternoon,</p>
<p>I discovered the bowl on my desk...</p>
<p>With just a few inches</p>
<p>of clear water in it...</p>
<p>And floating on the surface</p>
<p>was a flower petal.</p>
<p>As I watched, it sank.</p>
<p>But just before</p>
<p>it reached the bottom,</p>
<p>it transformed</p>
<p>into a wee fish.</p>
<p>It was beautiful magic.</p>
<p>Wondrous to behold.</p>
<p>The flower petal</p>
<p>had come from a lily.</p>
<p>Your mother.</p>
<p>The day I came downstairs,</p>
<p>day's the bowl was empty.</p>
<p>That's the day</p>
<p>your mother...</p>
<p>I know</p>
<p>why you're here.</p>
<p>But I can't help you.</p>
<p>It would ruin me.</p>
<p>Do you know</p>
<p>why I survived, Professor?</p>
<p>The night I got this?</p>
<p>Because of her,</p>
<p>because she sacrificed herself...</p>
<p>Because she refused</p>
<p>to step aside.</p>
<p>Because her love was more powerful</p>
<p>than Voldemort.</p>
<p>Don't say his name.</p>
<p>I'm not afraid of the name, Professor.</p>
<p>I'm going</p>
<p>to tell you something.</p>
<p>Something others</p>
<p>have only guessed at.</p>
<p>It's true.</p>
<p>I am the Chosen One.</p>
<p>Only I can destroy him,</p>
<p>but in order to do so,</p>
<p>I need to know</p>
<p>what Tom Riddle asked you</p>
<p>all those years ago</p>
<p>in your office</p>
<p>and I need to know</p>
<p>what you told him.</p>
<p>Be brave, Professor.</p>
<p>Be brave</p>
<p>like my mother.</p>
<p>Otherwise,</p>
<p>you disgrace her.</p>
<p>Otherwise,</p>
<p>she died for nothing.</p>
<p>Otherwise,</p>
<p>the bowl will remain empty.</p>
<p>Forever.</p>
<p>Please, don't think badly of me</p>
<p>when you say it.</p>
<p>I had no idea</p>
<p>what he was like, even then.</p>
<p>I was in the library</p>
<p>the other day.</p>
<p>In the restricted section...</p>
<p>and I read something</p>
<p>rather odd about this rare magic.</p>
<p>It's called, as I understand it,</p>
<p>a Horcrux.</p>
<p>I beg your pardon?</p>
<p>Horcrux.</p>
<p>I came across the term</p>
<p>while reading...</p>
<p>and I didn't fully</p>
<p>understand it.</p>
<p>I'm not sure</p>
<p>what you were reading, Tom,</p>
<p>but this is very dark stuff.</p>
<p>Very dark, indeed.</p>
<p>Which is...</p>
<p>why I came to you.</p>
<p>A horcrux is an object</p>
<p>in which a person has concealed</p>
<p>part of their soul.</p>
<p>But I don't understand</p>
<p>how that works, sir.</p>
<p>One splits one's soul</p>
<p>and hides part of it in an object.</p>
<p>By doing so,</p>
<p>you are protected,</p>
<p>should you be attacked</p>
<p>and your body destroyed.</p>
<p>Protected?</p>
<p>That part of your soul</p>
<p>which is hidden lives on.</p>
<p>In other words,</p>
<p>you cannot die.</p>
<p>And how does</p>
<p>one splits his soul, sir?</p>
<p>I think you already know</p>
<p>the answer to that, Tom.</p>
<p>Murder.</p>
<p>Yes, killing rips the soul apart</p>
<p>and it is a violation against nature.</p>
<p>Can you only</p>
<p>split the soul once?</p>
<p>For instance,</p>
<p>isn't seven--</p>
<p>Seven?</p>
<p>Merlin's beard, Tom!</p>
<p>Isn't it bad enough</p>
<p>to consider killing one person?</p>
<p>To rip the soul</p>
<p>in seven pieces!</p>
<p>This is all hypothetical,</p>
<p>isn't it, Tom?</p>
<p>All academic?</p>
<p>Of course, sir.</p>
<p>It'll be our little secret.</p>
<p>Sir.</p>
<p>This is beyond anything</p>
<p>I imagined.</p>
<p>Do you mean, sir,</p>
<p>he succeeded, sir?</p>
<p>In making a Horcrux?</p>
<p>Oh yes, he succeeded, alright.</p>
<p>And not just once.</p>
<p>What are they exactly?</p>
<p>It could be anything.</p>
<p>Most common place</p>
<p>of objects.</p>
<p>A ring, for example,</p>
<p>or a book.</p>
<p>Tom Riddle's diary.</p>
<p>It's a horcrux, yes.</p>
<p>Four years ago when you saved</p>
<p>Ginny Weasley's life</p>
<p>in the Chamber of Secrets,</p>
<p>you brought me this.</p>
<p>I knew then,</p>
<p>this was a different kind of magic.</p>
<p>Very dark,</p>
<p>very powerful.</p>
<p>But until tonight,</p>
<p>I had no idea just how powerful...</p>
<p>And the ring?</p>
<p>Belonged to Voldemort's mother.</p>
<p>Difficult to find.</p>
<p>Even more difficult to destroy.</p>
<p>But if you could find them all,</p>
<p>if you did destroy each Horcrux--</p>
<p>One destroys Voldemort.</p>
<p>How would you</p>
<p>find them?</p>
<p>They could be hidden anywhere,</p>
<p>couldn't they?</p>
<p>True, but magic,</p>
<p>especially dark magic...</p>
<p>leaves traces.</p>
<p>It's where you've been going,</p>
<p>isn't it, sir?</p>
<p>When you leave the school.</p>
<p>Yes, and I think perhaps,</p>
<p>I may have found another.</p>
<p>But this time,</p>
<p>I cannot hope to destroy it alone.</p>
<p>Once again, I must ask</p>
<p>too much of you, Harry.</p>
<p>Have you ever considered</p>
<p>that you ask too much,</p>
<p>that you take too much</p>
<p>for granted?</p>
<p>Has it ever crossed</p>
<p>your brilliant mind</p>
<p>that I don't want</p>
<p>to do this anymore?</p>
<p>Whether it has or hasn't</p>
<p>is irrelevant.</p>
<p>I will not negotiate</p>
<p>with you, Severus.</p>
<p>You agreed.</p>
<p>Nothing more to discuss.</p>
<p>Oh, Harry...</p>
<p>You need a shave,</p>
<p>my friend.</p>
<p>You know, at times,</p>
<p>I forget how much you've grown.</p>
<p>At times, I still see</p>
<p>the small boy from the cupboard.</p>
<p>Forgive my mawkishness, Harry.</p>
<p>I'm an old man.</p>
<p>You still look</p>
<p>the same to me, sir.</p>
<p>Just like your mother,</p>
<p>you are unfailingly kind.</p>
<p>A trait people never fail</p>
<p>to undervalue, I'm afraid.</p>
<p>The place to which we journey tonight</p>
<p>is extremely dangerous.</p>
<p>I promise you for the company of me</p>
<p>and I stand by that promise.</p>
<p>But there's one condition.</p>
<p>You must obey every command</p>
<p>I give you without question.</p>
<p>Yes, sir.</p>
<p>You do understand</p>
<p>what I'm saying.</p>
<p>Should I tell you to hide,</p>
<p>you hide.</p>
<p>Should I tell you to run,</p>
<p>you run.</p>
<p>Should I tell you to abandon me</p>
<p>and save yourself,</p>
<p>you must do so.</p>
<p>Your word, Harry.</p>
<p>My word.</p>
<p>Take my arm.</p>
<p>Sir, I thought you couldn't</p>
<p>Apparate within Hogwarts.</p>
<p>Well, being me</p>
<p>has its privileges.</p>
<p>This is the place.</p>
<p>Oh, yes.</p>
<p>This place has known magic.</p>
<p>Sir.</p>
<p>In order to gain passage,</p>
<p>payment must be made.</p>
<p>Payment intended</p>
<p>to weaken any intruder.</p>
<p>You should have</p>
<p>let me, sir.</p>
<p>No, no, Harry. Your blood's</p>
<p>much more precious than mine.</p>
<p>Voldemort would not have made it easy</p>
<p>to discover his hiding place.</p>
<p>He would put</p>
<p>certain defenses in position.</p>
<p>Careful.</p>
<p>There it is.</p>
<p>The only question is</p>
<p>how do we get there?</p>
<p>If you would, Harry.</p>
<p>Do you think</p>
<p>the Horcrux is in there, sir?</p>
<p>Oh, yes.</p>
<p>It has to be drunk.</p>
<p>All of it</p>
<p>has to be drunk.</p>
<p>You remember the conditions</p>
<p>on which I brought you with me?</p>
<p>This potion</p>
<p>might paralyze me.</p>
<p>I may risk</p>
<p>to get what I'm here.</p>
<p>I'd cause me so much pain</p>
<p>that I'd beg for relief.</p>
<p>You are not to indulge</p>
<p>these requests.</p>
<p>It's your job, Harry, to make sure</p>
<p>I keep drinking this potion.</p>
<p>Even if you have</p>
<p>to force it down my throat.</p>
<p>Understood?</p>
<p>Why can't I drink it, sir?</p>
<p>Because I'm much older,</p>
<p>much cleverer and much less valuable.</p>
<p>Your good health, Harry.</p>
<p>Professor.</p>
<p>Professor!</p>
<p>Professor.</p>
<p>Can you hear me?</p>
<p>Professor!</p>
<p>You have to keep drinking</p>
<p>like you said, remember?</p>
<p>Stop.</p>
<p>I will stop. I will stop.</p>
<p>But only--</p>
<p>only if you keep drinking.</p>
<p>Don't make me-- Kill me.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, sir.</p>
<p>Kill me!</p>
<p>All my fault.</p>
<p>My fault.</p>
<p>Just one more, sir.</p>
<p>One more, I promise.</p>
<p>I promise I'll do what you say.</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>I promise!</p>
<p>Please!</p>
<p>Harry.</p>
<p>Water.</p>
<p>Water.</p>
<p>Water.</p>
<p>Look, you did it, sir.</p>
<p>Look.</p>
<p>Harry...</p>
<p>water.</p>
<p>Aguamenti!</p>
<p>Water.</p>
<p>Lumos.</p>
<p>Lumos maxima!</p>
<p>Stupefy! Stupefy!</p>
<p>Sectumsempra!</p>
<p>Harry...</p>
<p>Incarcerous!</p>
<p>Stupefy!</p>
<p>Harry...</p>
<p>Harry...</p>
<p>Partis Temporus!</p>
<p>Go to your houses!</p>
<p>No toddling!</p>
<p>We need to get you</p>
<p>to the hospital wing, sir.</p>
<p>To Madam Pomfrey.</p>
<p>No...</p>
<p>Severus, Severus is awakening.</p>
<p>Wake him.</p>
<p>Tell him what happened.</p>
<p>Speak</p>
<p>to no one else.</p>
<p>Severus, Harry.</p>
<p>Hide yourself below,</p>
<p>Harry.</p>
<p>Don't speak or be seen by anybody</p>
<p>without my permission.</p>
<p>Whatever happens,</p>
<p>it's imperative you stay below.</p>
<p>Harry, do as I say.</p>
<p>Trust me.</p>
<p>Trust me.</p>
<p>Good evening, Draco.</p>
<p>What brings you here</p>
<p>on this fine spring evening?</p>
<p>Who else is here?</p>
<p>I heard you talking.</p>
<p>I often talk aloud to myself.</p>
<p>I find it extraordinarily useful.</p>
<p>Have you always been</p>
<p>to yourself, Draco?</p>
<p>Draco,</p>
<p>you are no assassin.</p>
<p>How do you know</p>
<p>what I am?</p>
<p>I've done things</p>
<p>that would shock you.</p>
<p>Oh, like cursing Katie Bell</p>
<p>and hoping that in return</p>
<p>she would bear</p>
<p>a cursed necklace to me?</p>
<p>Like replacing a bottle of mead</p>
<p>with one lace with poison.</p>
<p>Forgive me, Draco,</p>
<p>I cannot help feel</p>
<p>these actions are so weak</p>
<p>that your...</p>
<p>heart can't</p>
<p>really have been in.</p>
<p>He trusts me.</p>
<p>I was chosen.</p>
<p>I shall make it</p>
<p>easy for you.</p>
<p>Expelliarmus!</p>
<p>Very good.</p>
<p>Very good.</p>
<p>You're not alone.</p>
<p>There are others.</p>
<p>How?</p>
<p>The Vanishing Cabinet</p>
<p>in the Room of Requirement.</p>
<p>I've been mending it.</p>
<p>Let me guess, it has a sister.</p>
<p>A twin.</p>
<p>In Borgin and Burkes.</p>
<p>They form a passage.</p>
<p>Ingenious.</p>
<p>Draco, years ago, I knew a boy</p>
<p>who made all the wrong choices.</p>
<p>Please let me</p>
<p>help you.</p>
<p>I don't want your help.</p>
<p>Don't you understand?</p>
<p>I have to do this.</p>
<p>I have to kill you.</p>
<p>Or he's gonna kill me.</p>
<p>Oh,</p>
<p>look what we have here.</p>
<p>Well done, Draco.</p>
<p>Good evening, Bellatrix.</p>
<p>I think introductions aren't over,</p>
<p>don't you?</p>
<p>Love to, Albus,</p>
<p>but I'm afraid</p>
<p>we're on a bit of tight schedule.</p>
<p>Do it!</p>
<p>He doesn't have</p>
<p>the stomach.</p>
<p>Just like his father.</p>
<p>Let me finish him</p>
<p>in my own way.</p>
<p>No, the Dark Lord was clear</p>
<p>the boy has to do it.</p>
<p>This is your moment, Draco.</p>
<p>Do it!</p>
<p>Go on, Draco,</p>
<p>now!</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Severus.</p>
<p>Please...</p>
<p>Avada Kedavra.</p>
<p>Hagrid!</p>
<p>Snape,</p>
<p>he trusted you!</p>
<p>Go on!</p>
<p>Incarcerous!</p>
<p>Fight back, you coward!</p>
<p>Fight back!</p>
<p>No, he belongs</p>
<p>to the Dark Lord.</p>
<p>Sectumsempra!</p>
<p>You dare use my own spells</p>
<p>against me, Potter?</p>
<p>Yes,</p>
<p>I'm the Half-Blood Prince.</p>
<p>Potter...</p>
<p>Enlighten</p>
<p>what has happened.</p>
<p>If you should have the need</p>
<p>to talk to someone...</p>
<p>You should know...</p>
<p>Professor Dumbledore...</p>
<p>You meant</p>
<p>a great deal to him.</p>
<p>Do you think</p>
<p>he would have done it?</p>
<p>Draco.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No, he was lowering</p>
<p>his wand.</p>
<p>In the end,</p>
<p>it was Snape.</p>
<p>It was always Snape.</p>
<p>I did nothing.</p>
<p>It was fake.</p>
<p>Open it.</p>
<p>To the Dark Lord:</p>
<p>I know I will be dead</p>
<p>long before you read this</p>
<p>but I want you</p>
<p>to know</p>
<p>that it was I</p>
<p>who discovered your secret.</p>
<p>I have stolen</p>
<p>the real Horcrux</p>
<p>and intend to destroy it</p>
<p>as soon as I can.</p>
<p>I face death in the hope</p>
<p>that when you meet your match,</p>
<p>you will be mortal</p>
<p>once more.</p>
<p>R.A.B.</p>
<p>R.A.B.?</p>
<p>Don't know.</p>
<p>But whoever they are,</p>
<p>they have the real Horcrux.</p>
<p>It means</p>
<p>it was all a waste.</p>
<p>All of it.</p>
<p>Ron's okay with you,</p>
<p>you know.</p>
<p>You and Ginny.</p>
<p>If I were you when he's around,</p>
<p>I'd keep snogging to a minimum.</p>
<p>I'm not coming back,</p>
<p>Hermione.</p>
<p>I got to finish</p>
<p>whatever Dumbledore started.</p>
<p>And I don't know</p>
<p>where that'll leave me,</p>
<p>but I'll let you and Ron</p>
<p>know where I am...</p>
<p>when I can.</p>
<p>I've always admired</p>
<p>your courage, Harry.</p>
<p>But sometimes,</p>
<p>you can be really thick.</p>
<p>You don't really think</p>
<p>you're going to be able</p>
<p>to find all those Horcruxes</p>
<p>by yourself, do you?</p>
<p>You need us, Harry.</p>
<p>I never realised</p>
<p>how beautiful this place was.</p>
