<h2>Harry Potter and Deathly Hallows Part Two</h2>
<p>It's beautiful here.</p>
<p>It was our aunt's.</p>
<p>We used to come here as kids.</p>
<p>The Order uses it now as a safe house.</p>
<p>What's left of us atleast.</p>
<p>Muggles think these things keep evil away.</p>
<p>But they're wrong.</p>
<p>I need to talk to the Goblin.</p>
<p>How are you?</p>
<p>You buried the elf?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And brought me here.</p>
<p>You are...</p>
<p>Pretty unusual, is it?</p>
<p>How did you come by the sword?</p>
<p>It's complicated.</p>
<p>Why did Bellatrix Lestrange think</p>
<p>that it should be in her vault at Gringotts?</p>
<p>It's complicated.</p>
<p>The sword presented itself to us,</p>
<p>in moment of need.</p>
<p>We didn't steal it.</p>
<p>There is a sword in Madam Lestrange's vault</p>
<p>identical to this one.</p>
<p>But it is a fake.</p>
<p>It was placed there this past summer.</p>
<p>And she never suspected it was a fake.</p>
<p>The replica is very convincing.</p>
<p>Only a goblin would recognize that this is the true Sword of Gryffindor.</p>
<p>Who is the acquaintance?</p>
<p>A Hogwarts Professor.</p>
<p>As I understand that he's now Headmaster.</p>
<p>Snape.</p>
<p>He put a fake sword in Bellatrix's vault.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>There are more than a fewcurious things</p>
<p>in the vaults at Gringotts.</p>
<p>And in Madam Lestrange's vault as well?</p>
<p>Perhaps.</p>
<p>I need to get into Gringotts.</p>
<p>Into one of the vaults.</p>
<p>It is impossible.</p>
<p>Alone, yes.</p>
<p>But with you, no.</p>
<p>Why should I help you?</p>
<p>I have gold.</p>
<p>Lots of...</p>
<p>I've no interest in gold.</p>
<p>Then what?</p>
<p>That.</p>
<p>That is my price.</p>
<p>Are you thinking there's a Horcrux in Bellatrix's vault?</p>
<p>Well, she was terrified when she thought we had been in there.</p>
<p>She kept asking you,</p>
<p>what else was taken?</p>
<p>I bet you anything, there's Horcrux in there.</p>
<p>Another piece of his soul.</p>
<p>Let's find it, kill it, and we are</p>
<p>one step closer to killing him.</p>
<p>And what happens when we find it,</p>
<p>How're we supposed to destroy it, now you're giving the sword to Griphook?</p>
<p>I'm still working on that part.</p>
<p>He's weak.</p>
<p>Who?</p>
<p>Mr. Ollivander</p>
<p>I need to ask you a few questions.</p>
<p>Anything, m'boy.</p>
<p>Anything!</p>
<p>Would you mind identifying this wand?</p>
<p>We need to know if it's safe to use.</p>
<p>Uhh... Walnut</p>
<p>Dragon Heartstring</p>
<p>Unyie...</p>
<p>Unyielding.</p>
<p>This belonged to Bellatrix Lestrange.</p>
<p>Treat it carefully.</p>
<p>And this?</p>
<p>Hawthorn.</p>
<p>An unicorn hair.</p>
<p>Reasonably pliant.</p>
<p>This was the wand of Draco Malfoy.</p>
<p>Was?</p>
<p>Is it not still?</p>
<p>Well, perhaps not.</p>
<p>If you won it from him.</p>
<p>I sense its allegiance has changed.</p>
<p>You talk about wands,</p>
<p>as if they have feelings...</p>
<p>...can think!</p>
<p>The wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter.</p>
<p>That much has always been clear to</p>
<p>those of us who've studied wandlore.</p>
<p>And, what do you know about the Deathly Hallows?</p>
<p>It is rumored there are three.</p>
<p>The Elder Wand, the Cloak of Invisibility,</p>
<p>to hide you from your enemies...</p>
<p>and the Resurrection Stone, to bring</p>
<p>back loved ones from the dead.</p>
<p>Together, they make one the Master of Death.</p>
<p>But, few truly believe that such objects exist.</p>
<p>Do you?</p>
<p>Do you believe they exist, sir?</p>
<p>Well...</p>
<p>I see no reasons to put</p>
<p>stock into an old wives' tale.</p>
<p>You're lying!</p>
<p>You know one exists.</p>
<p>You told him about it.</p>
<p>You told him about the Elder Wand...</p>
<p>and where he could go looking for it.</p>
<p>He tortured me.</p>
<p>Besides...</p>
<p>...I only conveyed rumors.</p>
<p>There's...</p>
<p>There's no telling whether he will find it.</p>
<p>He has found it, sir.</p>
<p>We'll let you rest.</p>
<p>He's after you, Mr. Potter.</p>
<p>If it's true what you say,</p>
<p>that he has the Elder Wand,</p>
<p>I'm afraid,</p>
<p>...you really don't stand a chance.</p>
<p>Well, I am supposed to kill him, before he finds me, then.</p>
<p>You're sure that's hers?</p>
<p>Positive.</p>
<p>Well?</p>
<p>How do I look?</p>
<p>Hideous.</p>
<p>You can give that to Hermione to hold.</p>
<p>Alright, Griphook?</p>
<p>We're relying on you, Griphook.</p>
<p>If you get us past the guards into the vault...</p>
<p>The sword's yours.</p>
<p>Madam Lestrange.</p>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>Good morning?</p>
<p>Good morning?</p>
<p>You're Bellatrix Lestrange,</p>
<p>not a school girl!</p>
<p>Hey!</p>
<p>Easy!</p>
<p>If she gives us away, we must swear</p>
<p>to use that sword to slit our own throats.</p>
<p>Understand?</p>
<p>No, he's right.</p>
<p>I speak stupid.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Let's do it.</p>
<p>I wish to enter my vault.</p>
<p>Identification?</p>
<p>I hardly think that would be necessary.</p>
<p>Madam Lestrange.</p>
<p>I don't like to be kept waiting.</p>
<p>I know...</p>
<p>They know she's an impostor.</p>
<p>They'd be warned.</p>
<p>Harry...</p>
<p>What do we do, Harry?</p>
<p>Madam Lestrange,</p>
<p>would you mind presenting your wand?</p>
<p>And why should I do that?</p>
<p>It's the bank's policy!</p>
<p>I'm sure you understand, given current climate.</p>
<p>No! I most certainly do not understand!</p>
<p>I'm afraid, I must insist.</p>
<p>Imperio!</p>
<p>Very well, Madam Lestrange.</p>
<p>If you would follow me?</p>
<p>What is that, Griphook?</p>
<p>Griphook!</p>
<p>Aresto Momentum</p>
<p>Well done, Hermione.</p>
<p>Oh no, you two're like you again.</p>
<p>The Thief's Downfall,</p>
<p>washes away all enchantment.</p>
<p>Can be deadly.</p>
<p>You don't say.</p>
<p>Just out of interest,</p>
<p>is there any other way outta here?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>What the devil are all you doing down here?</p>
<p>Thieves!</p>
<p>You gave up the...</p>
<p>-Imperio</p>
<p>-You!</p>
<p>That doesn't sound good.</p>
<p>Bloody hell!</p>
<p>It's an Ukrainian Ironbelly.</p>
<p>Here.</p>
<p>It's been trained to expect pain</p>
<p>when it hears this noise.</p>
<p>That's barbaric!</p>
<p>Lumos.</p>
<p>Blimey!</p>
<p>Accio Horcrux!</p>
<p>You seem you're gonna try</p>
<p>this here, won't you?</p>
<p>No kind of magic would work in here.</p>
<p>It's in here, Harry?</p>
<p>Can you feel anything?</p>
<p>That's it!</p>
<p>Up there!</p>
<p>They have added the Gemino curse.</p>
<p>Everything you touch will multiply.</p>
<p>Give me the sword.</p>
<p>Stop moving!</p>
<p>Do it!</p>
<p>We had deal, Griphook!</p>
<p>The cup for the sword!</p>
<p>I said I'll get you in,</p>
<p>I didn't say anything about getting you out.</p>
<p>Griphook! Thieves!</p>
<p>Griphook!</p>
<p>Hey, thieves!</p>
<p>Is that okay?</p>
<p>We've still got Bogrod.</p>
<p>That's unfortunate.</p>
<p>We can't just stand here,</p>
<p>You got any idea?</p>
<p>Should be a brilliant one.</p>
<p>I've got something,</p>
<p>but it's mad!</p>
<p>Reducto</p>
<p>Well, come on, then!</p>
<p>Relashio</p>
<p>Keep moving!</p>
<p>Now what?</p>
<p>Reducto</p>
<p>Hold on.</p>
<p>That was brilliant!</p>
<p>Absolutely brilliant!</p>
<p>We're dropping!</p>
<p>I say we jump!</p>
<p>When?</p>
<p>Now!</p>
<p>He knows.</p>
<p>You-Know-Who.</p>
<p>He knows we broke into Gringotts.</p>
<p>He knows what we took,</p>
<p>and he knows we're hunting Horcruxes.</p>
<p>How did he know?</p>
<p>I saw him.</p>
<p>You let him in?</p>
<p>Harry, you can't do that!</p>
<p>Hermione, I can't always help it!</p>
<p>Well, maybe I can.</p>
<p>I don't know!</p>
<p>Never mind!</p>
<p>What happened?</p>
<p>Well, he's angry...</p>
<p>and scared too.</p>
<p>He knows, if we find and destroy</p>
<p>all the Horcruxes, we'll be able to kill him.</p>
<p>I reckon he'll stop at nothing</p>
<p>to make sure we don't find the rest.</p>
<p>And there's more.</p>
<p>One of them is at Hogwarts.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>You saw it?</p>
<p>I saw the castle.</p>
<p>And Rowena Ravenclaw.</p>
<p>It must have something to do with her.</p>
<p>We have to go there, now!</p>
<p>Well, we can't do that!</p>
<p>We've got to plan,</p>
<p>we've got to figure it out!</p>
<p>Hermione, when have any of</p>
<p>our plans ever actually worked?</p>
<p>We plan, we get there,</p>
<p>all hell breaks loose.</p>
<p>He's right!</p>
<p>One problem...</p>
<p>Snape's Headmaster now,</p>
<p>we can't just move freely from the front door!</p>
<p>Well, we'll go to Hogsmeade,</p>
<p>to Honeydukes.</p>
<p>Take the secret passage in the cellar.</p>
<p>It's...</p>
<p>There's something wrong with him.</p>
<p>It's like, you know,</p>
<p>in the past...</p>
<p>I've always been able</p>
<p>to follow his thoughts.</p>
<p>And now everything just feels disconnected.</p>
<p>Maybe it's the Horcruxes.</p>
<p>Maybe he's getting weaker.</p>
<p>Maybe he's dying!</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>No, it's.. it's more like he's wounded.</p>
<p>If anything, he feels more dangerous.</p>
<p>Right here. Come on!</p>
<p>Search everywhere.</p>
<p>Go, move!</p>
<p>Faster!</p>
<p>In here, Potter.</p>
<p>Come on, move!</p>
<p>Did you look at him.</p>
<p>For a second I thought that was...</p>
<p>I know. Dumbledore!</p>
<p>Harry?</p>
<p>I can see you in this.</p>
<p>Bloody fools, what are you thinking coming here?</p>
<p>Have you any idea how dangerous it is?</p>
<p>You're Aberforth, Dumbledore's brother.</p>
<p>It's you who I've been seeing in here.</p>
<p>You're the one who sent Dobby.</p>
<p>Why've you left him?</p>
<p>He's dead.</p>
<p>Sorry to hear it.</p>
<p>I liked that elf.</p>
<p>Who gave that to you?</p>
<p>The mirror?</p>
<p>Mundungus Fletcher, about a year ago.</p>
<p>Dung had no right selling that to you.</p>
<p>It belongs to...</p>
<p>Sirius...</p>
<p>Albus told me.</p>
<p>He also told me you'd likely be hacked off,</p>
<p>...if you ever found that I had it.</p>
<p>But, ask yourself;</p>
<p>Where would you be if I didn't?</p>
<p>Do you have any others much?</p>
<p>From the Order?</p>
<p>The Order has finished.</p>
<p>You-Know-Who has won,</p>
<p>...anyone who says otherwise</p>
<p>is killing themselves.</p>
<p>We need to get into Hogwarts, tonight.</p>
<p>Dumbledore gave us a job to do.</p>
<p>Did he now...</p>
<p>Nice job?</p>
<p>Easy?</p>
<p>We've been hunting Horcruxes.</p>
<p>We think the last one's inside the castle.</p>
<p>But we'll need your help getting in.</p>
<p>Which job my brother has given you, it's a suicide mission.</p>
<p>Do yourself a favor, boy.</p>
<p>Go home!</p>
<p>Live a little longer.</p>
<p>Dumbledore trusted me to see this through.</p>
<p>What makes you think you can trust him?</p>
<p>What makes you think you can</p>
<p>believe anything my brother told you?</p>
<p>And in all the time you knew him...</p>
<p>Did he ever mention my name?</p>
<p>Did he ever mentioned hers?</p>
<p>Why should he...</p>
<p>Keep secrets.</p>
<p>You tell me?</p>
<p>I trusted him.</p>
<p>That's the boy's answer.</p>
<p>A boy goes chasing Horcruxes is on the word of</p>
<p>a man who wouldn't even tell him where to start.</p>
<p>You're lying!</p>
<p>Not just on me, it doesn't matter.</p>
<p>To yourself as well.</p>
<p>That's what a fool does.</p>
<p>You don't strike me as a fool, Harry Potter!</p>
<p>So, I ask you again, there must be a reason.</p>
<p>I'm not interested in what happened</p>
<p>between you and your brother.</p>
<p>I don't care that you've given up.</p>
<p>I trusted the man I knew.</p>
<p>We need to get into the castle tonight.</p>
<p>You know what to do.</p>
<p>Where have you sent her?</p>
<p>You'll see.</p>
<p>Soon enough.</p>
<p>That's your sister, Ariana.</p>
<p>Isn't it?</p>
<p>She died very young, didn't she?</p>
<p>My brother sacrificed many things, Mr. Potter.</p>
<p>On his journey to find power.</p>
<p>Including Ariana.</p>
<p>And she was devoted to him.</p>
<p>He gave her everything.</p>
<p>But time.</p>
<p>Thank you, Mr. Dumbledore.</p>
<p>He did save our lives twice!</p>
<p>Kept an eye on us on that mirror.</p>
<p>That doesn't seem like someone who's given up!</p>
<p>She's coming back.</p>
<p>What's that with her?</p>
<p>Neville!</p>
<p>How you look...</p>
<p>Like hell, I reckon.</p>
<p>But this is nothing.</p>
<p>Seamus is worse.</p>
<p>Hey, Ab!</p>
<p>We've got a couple more coming through.</p>
<p>Don't remember this on the Marauder's Map.</p>
<p>That's because it never existed till now.</p>
<p>The seven secret passages were sealed off,</p>
<p>before the start of the year.</p>
<p>This is the only way in or out, now.</p>
<p>The grounds are crawled with Death Eaters and Dementors.</p>
<p>How about Mr.Snape as Headmaster?</p>
<p>Hardly ever seen.</p>
<p>It's the Carrows who's watching out for.</p>
<p>Carrows?</p>
<p>Yeah. Brother and sister.</p>
<p>Incharge of discipline.</p>
<p>They like punishment, the Carrows.</p>
<p>They did that to you?</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Today's Dark Arts lesson was</p>
<p>practicing the Cruciatus curse.</p>
<p>On first years.</p>
<p>I refused.</p>
<p>Hogwarts has changed.</p>
<p>Let's have a bit of fun, shall we?</p>
<p>Hey, you lots! It's</p>
<p>for your surprise.</p>
<p>No more about Aberforth's cook's gonna help.</p>
<p>We'll be surprised if it's just digested.</p>
<p>Oh my!</p>
<p>Harry!</p>
<p>Get the word out to Remus and the others, that Harry is back.</p>
<p>Okay, okay!</p>
<p>Let's not kill him before You-Know-Who does.</p>
<p>...Do you read? we've a new weather report.</p>
<p>Lightning has struck. I repeat: Lightning has struck.</p>
<p>What's the fun, Harry?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>There's something we need to find.</p>
<p>There's something hidden here, in the castle.</p>
<p>And it may help us to defeat</p>
<p>You-Know-Who.</p>
<p>Alright, what is it?</p>
<p>We don't know.</p>
<p>Where is it?</p>
<p>We don't know that either.</p>
<p>I realize that's not much to go on.</p>
<p>That's nothing to go on.</p>
<p>I think it has something to do with Ravenclaw.</p>
<p>It'll be small, easily concealed.</p>
<p>Anyone, any ideas?</p>
<p>Well, there's Rowena Ravenclaw's lost diadem.</p>
<p>Oh, bloody hell!</p>
<p>Here we go!</p>
<p>Lost diadem of Ravenclaw?</p>
<p>Hasn't anyone heard of it?</p>
<p>It's quite famous.</p>
<p>Yes. But, Luna, it's lost.</p>
<p>For centuries.</p>
<p>There's no person alive today who's seen it.</p>
<p>Excuse me, can someone tell me what bloody diadem is?</p>
<p>It's a sort of crown.</p>
<p>You know, like a tiara.</p>
<p>Harry!</p>
<p>Hi, there.</p>
<p>Six months she hasn't seen me and</p>
<p>it's like I'm a frankie first-year.</p>
<p>I'm her brother!</p>
<p>She got lots of them, but she has got only one Harry.</p>
<p>Shut up, Seamus!</p>
<p>What is it, Ginny?</p>
<p>Snape knows... he knows</p>
<p>that Harry was spotted in Hogsmeade.</p>
<p>Many of you are surely wondering,</p>
<p>why I have summoned you at this hour.</p>
<p>It's come to my attention,</p>
<p>that earlier this evening...</p>
<p>Harry Potter was sighted in Hogsmeade.</p>
<p>Now...</p>
<p>should anyone...</p>
<p>student or staff attempt to aid Mr. Potter?</p>
<p>They will be punished in a manner consistent with</p>
<p>the severity of their transcription, further more...</p>
<p>Any person found have</p>
<p>knowledge of these events...</p>
<p>who fails to come forward...</p>
<p>will be treated as equally guilty.</p>
<p>Another...</p>
<p>If anyone in here has any knowledge of</p>
<p>Mr. Potter's movements this evening.</p>
<p>I invite them to step forward.</p>
<p>Now!</p>
<p>It seems, despite your exhaustive defensive strategies,</p>
<p>...you still have a security problem, Headmaster.</p>
<p>I'm afraid it's quite extensive.</p>
<p>How dare you stand where he stood?</p>
<p>Tell them how it happened that night?</p>
<p>Tell them how you looked him in the eye...</p>
<p>A man who trusted you, and killed him.</p>
<p>Tell them!</p>
<p>COWARD!</p>
<p>Harry.</p>
<p>Potter?</p>
<p>I know that many of you will want to fight.</p>
<p>Some of you might even think to fight is wise.</p>
<p>But this is folly.</p>
<p>Give me Harry Potter.</p>
<p>Do this and none shall be harmed.</p>
<p>Give me Harry Potter, and I shall leave Hogwarts untouched.</p>
<p>Give me Harry Potter, and you will be rewarded.</p>
<p></p><p></p>
<p>You have one hour.</p>
<p>What're you waiting for?</p>
<p>Someone grab him!</p>
<p>Students out of bed!</p>
<p>Students in the corridor!</p>
<p>They're supposed to be out of bed,</p>
<p>you blithering idiot!</p>
<p>Sorry ma'am.</p>
<p>As it happens, Mr. Filch...</p>
<p>Your arrival is most opportune.</p>
<p>If you would, I wouldd like you please, to lead Miss Parkinson</p>
<p>and the rest of Slytherin house, from the hall.</p>
<p>Exactly where is it I'll be leading 'em to, ma'am?</p>
<p>The dungeons would do.</p>
<p>I presume you have a reason for returning, Potter.</p>
<p>What is it you need?</p>
<p>Time, Professor.</p>
<p>As much as you can get me.</p>
<p>Do what you have to do.</p>
<p>I'll secure the castle.</p>
<p>Potter...</p>
<p>It's good to see you.</p>
<p>It's good to see you too, Professor.</p>
<p>Hold the fort, Neville.</p>
<p>Harry!</p>
<p>Hermione and I were thinking,</p>
<p>it doesn't matter if we find the Horcrux.</p>
<p>What do you mean?</p>
<p>Unless we can destroy it.</p>
<p>So, we were thinking...</p>
<p>Well, Ron was thinking, it was Ron's idea.</p>
<p>It was completely brilliant</p>
<p>You destroyed Tom Riddle's diary</p>
<p>with a Basilisk fang, right?</p>
<p>Well, me and Hermione did remind</p>
<p>where we might find one.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay, but take this.</p>
<p>That way, you can find me when you get back.</p>
<p>Where're you going?</p>
<p>Ravenclaw common room,</p>
<p>Gotta start somewhere.</p>
<p>Harry!</p>
<p>Harry!</p>
<p>Let me get this straight, Professor...</p>
<p>You're actually giving us</p>
<p>permission to do this?</p>
<p>That is correct, Longbottom.</p>
<p>That's blowing up!</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Wicked!</p>
<p>But how on earth are we gonna do that?</p>
<p>Why don't you confer with Mr. Finnigan?</p>
<p>As I recall, he has a particular</p>
<p>proclivity for pyro-technics.</p>
<p>I can bring it down.</p>
<p>That's the spirit!</p>
<p>Well, you go.</p>
<p>You do realize, of course, we can't</p>
<p>keep out You-Know-Who indefinitely.</p>
<p>That doesn't mean</p>
<p>we can't delay him.</p>
<p>And his name is Voldemort.</p>
<p>Filius, you might as well use it.</p>
<p>He's come to try to kill you, either way!</p>
<p>Piertotum Locomotor.</p>
<p>Hogwarts is threatened.</p>
<p>Man the boundaries! Protect us.</p>
<p>Do your duty...</p>
<p>...to our school.</p>
<p>I always wanted to use that spell!</p>
<p>Protego Maxima</p>
<p>Fianto Duri</p>
<p>Repello Inimigotum</p>
<p>Protego Maxima</p>
<p>Fianto Duri</p>
<p>Repello...</p>
<p>Protego Maxima</p>
<p>Fianto Duri</p>
<p>Repello Inimigotum</p>
<p>Protego Maxima</p>
<p>Harry, wait!</p>
<p>I need to talk to you!</p>
<p>I'm a bit pre-occupied at the moment, Luna.</p>
<p>You don't know where you're going.</p>
<p>You're wasting your time!</p>
<p>Look, we'll talk later, okay?</p>
<p>Harry?</p>
<p>Later.</p>
<p>Harry Potter, you listen to me right now!</p>
<p>Do you remember what Cho said</p>
<p>about Rowena Ravenclaw's diadem?</p>
<p>There is not a person alive who's seen it.</p>
<p>It's obvious, isn't it?</p>
<p>We have to talk to someone who's dead.</p>
<p>It's very impressive, isn't it?</p>
<p>If you want to find her,</p>
<p>you'll find her down there.</p>
<p>Aren't you coming?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I think it's best if you two talk alone.</p>
<p>She's very shy.</p>
<p>You're the Grey Lady.</p>
<p>The ghost of Ravenclaw tower.</p>
<p>I do not answer to that name!</p>
<p>No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!</p>
<p>It's Helena, isn't it?</p>
<p>Helena Ravenclaw,</p>
<p>Rowena's daughter.</p>
<p>Are you a friend of Luna's?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And she thought you might be able to help me.</p>
<p>You seek my mother's diadem?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>That's right.</p>
<p>Luna is kind.</p>
<p>Unlike so many of the others.</p>
<p>But she was wrong,</p>
<p>I cannot help you!</p>
<p>Wait, please!</p>
<p>I want to destroy it!</p>
<p>They never learn.</p>
<p>Such a pity.</p>
<p>My Lord...</p>
<p>Shouldn't we wait?</p>
<p>Begin!</p>
<p>I thought you want to do it.</p>
<p>Isn't it, Helena?</p>
<p>You want it destroyed?</p>
<p>Another promised</p>
<p>to destroy it many years ago.</p>
<p>A strange boy with a strange name?</p>
<p>Tom Riddle.</p>
<p>But he lied.</p>
<p>He lied to many people.</p>
<p>I know what he's done!</p>
<p>I know who he is!</p>
<p>He defiled it, with dark magic!</p>
<p>I can destroy it.</p>
<p>Once and for all.</p>
<p>But only if you tell me</p>
<p>where he hid it?</p>
<p>You do know where he hid it?</p>
<p>Don't you, Helena?</p>
<p>You just have to tell me.</p>
<p>Please!</p>
<p>Strange!</p>
<p>You remind me of him a bit.</p>
<p>It's here, in the castle.</p>
<p>In the place where everything is hidden.</p>
<p>If you have to ask...</p>
<p>...you will never know.</p>
<p>If you know...</p>
<p>...you need only ask.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
<p>Tell Professor McGonagall.</p>
<p>Remus and I will handle this side of the castle.</p>
<p>Yes, sir!</p>
<p>Hey Dean, with second thoughts, tell Professor McGonagall we</p>
<p>might need one or two more wands this side.</p>
<p>It is the quality of one's convictions that determines one's success..</p>
<p>...not the number of followers.</p>
<p>Who said that?</p>
<p>Me.</p>
<p>You okay, Freddie?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Me too.</p>
<p>Harry talks this in sleep.</p>
<p>You know it?</p>
<p>No, of course, not!</p>
<p>Yeah?</p>
<p>You-Know-Who's army?</p>
<p>You do it.</p>
<p>I can't.</p>
<p>Yes, you can!</p>
<p>Neville!</p>
<p>That went well.</p>
<p>Get inside!</p>
<p>Stupefy</p>
<p>Ginny, Neville!</p>
<p>You alright?</p>
<p>Never better!</p>
<p>I feel like I can spit fire!</p>
<p>Have you seen Luna up there?</p>
<p>Luna?</p>
<p>I'm mad for her. I think it�s about time I told her</p>
<p>since we�ll probably both be dead by dawn.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>Bloody hell!</p>
<p>We'll never find him on this.</p>
<p>Here he is!</p>
<p>He's just...</p>
<p>Brilliant!</p>
<p>He just vanished.</p>
<p>I'm sure I saw it.</p>
<p>Maybe he's gone to the Room of Requirement.</p>
<p>It doesn't show up on the map, does it?</p>
<p>You said that last year.</p>
<p>That's right, I did.</p>
<p>Let's go.</p>
<p>Brilliant!</p>
<p>Come on!</p>
<p>Well, well...</p>
<p>What brings you here, Potter?</p>
<p>I could ask you the same.</p>
<p>You have something that's mine.</p>
<p>I'd like it back.</p>
<p>What's wrong with the wand you have?</p>
<p>It's my mother's.</p>
<p>It's powerful, but it's...</p>
<p>..not the same.</p>
<p>Doesn't quite understand me.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Why didn't you tell her?</p>
<p>Bellatrix?</p>
<p>You knew it was me.</p>
<p>You didn't say anything.</p>
<p>Come on, Draco!</p>
<p>Don't be a prat.</p>
<p>Do it!</p>
<p>Easy!</p>
<p>Expelliarmus</p>
<p>Avada Kedavra</p>
<p>Stupefy</p>
<p>This is my girlfriend,</p>
<p>you bloody gits!</p>
<p>Got it!</p>
<p>They've set the bloody place on fire!</p>
<p>Come on!</p>
<p>This way!</p>
<p>We can't leave them!</p>
<p>He's joking, right?</p>
<p>If we die for them,</p>
<p>Harry, I'm gonna kill you!</p>
<p>Harry!</p>
<p>My Lord?</p>
<p>Avada Kedavra!</p>
<p>Come Nagini, I need to keep you safe.</p>
<p>It's the snake.</p>
<p>She's the last one.</p>
<p>It's the last Horcrux.</p>
<p>Look inside him, Harry.</p>
<p>Find out where he is,</p>
<p>if you find him, we can find the snake.</p>
<p>And we can end this!</p>
<p>My Lord...</p>
<p>Might it be less...</p>
<p>I should not be more prudent to call off this attack.</p>
<p>Simply seek the boy.</p>
<p>Yourself.</p>
<p>I do not need to seek the boy...</p>
<p>...before the night is out, he will come to me!</p>
<p>Do you understand?</p>
<p>Look at me!</p>
<p>How can you live with yourself, Lucius?</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>Go and find Severus.</p>
<p>Bring him to me.</p>
<p>I know where he is.</p>
<p>Come on!</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>You have performed extra-ordinary magic</p>
<p>with this wand, My Lord,</p>
<p>in the last few hours alone.</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>No! I am extra-ordinary.</p>
<p>But the wand resists me .</p>
<p>There is no wand more powerful.</p>
<p>Ollivander himself has said it.</p>
<p>Tonight, when the boy comes.</p>
<p>It will not fail you, I am sure ...</p>
<p>It answers to you,</p>
<p>and you only.</p>
<p>Does it?</p>
<p>My Lord?</p>
<p>The wand, does it truly</p>
<p>answer to me?</p>
<p>You're a clever man, Severus.</p>
<p>Surely you must know...</p>
<p>Where does its true loyalty lie?</p>
<p>With you...</p>
<p>Of course, My Lord.</p>
<p>The Elder Wand cannot serve me properly,</p>
<p>because I am not its true master.</p>
<p>The Elder Wand belongs to the</p>
<p>wizard who killed its last owner.</p>
<p>You killed Dumbledore, Severus.</p>
<p>While you live, the Elder</p>
<p>Wand cannot truly be mine.</p>
<p>You've been a good and faithful servant, Severus.</p>
<p>But only I can live forever.</p>
<p>My Lord...</p>
<p>Nagini, kill!</p>
<p>Take it...</p>
<p>Take it up, please!</p>
<p>Give me something!</p>
<p>Quickly, a flask. Anything!</p>
<p>Take them to the Pensieve.</p>
<p>Look at me...</p>
<p>You really have your mother's eyes.</p>
<p>You've fought valiantly,</p>
<p>but in vain...</p>
<p>I do not wish this. Every drop of magical blood</p>
<p>spilled is a terrible waste.</p>
<p>I therefore command my forces to retreat...</p>
<p>In their absence,</p>
<p>dispose your dead with dignity,</p>
<p>Harry Potter, I now speak directly to you.</p>
<p>On this night, you have allowed your friends to die</p>
<p>for you, rather than face me yourself.</p>
<p>There is no greater dishonor.</p>
<p>Join me in the Forbidden Forrest...</p>
<p>...and confront your fate.</p>
<p>If you do not do this, I shall kill every last man,</p>
<p>woman and child who tries to conceal you from me.</p>
<p>Where's everybody?</p>
<p>Harry?</p>
<p>Oh, come on!</p>
<p>Don't be sad on it, she's passed.</p>
<p>There, she's gone.</p>
<p>Freak! Come here! I'm gonna tell mommy!</p>
<p>You're freak!</p>
<p>You're freak, Lily!</p>
<p>Come here!</p>
<p>She's jealous.</p>
<p>She's ordinary and you're special.</p>
<p>That's not true, Severus.</p>
<p>Gryffindor!</p>
<p>Hi, I'm James.</p>
<p>Hi, I'm Lily.</p>
<p>Just like your father.</p>
<p>Don't say a word against my father!</p>
<p>Masters shall be reunited once more!</p>
<p>Severus.</p>
<p>Don't kill me!</p>
<p>The prophecy did not refer to a woman.</p>
<p>It spoke about a boy born at the end of the July.</p>
<p>Yes, but it's her son!</p>
<p>He intends to hunt them down and kill them.</p>
<p>Hide him... hide them all.</p>
<p>I beg you!</p>
<p>What would you give me in exchange, Severus?</p>
<p>Anything.</p>
<p>Harry...</p>
<p>Harry, you were so loved.</p>
<p>So loved!</p>
<p>Harry, mama loves you.</p>
<p>Dadda loves you.</p>
<p>Harry, be safe.</p>
<p>Be strong.</p>
<p>Avada Kedavra!</p>
<p>You said you would keep her safe.</p>
<p>Lily and James...</p>
<p>put their faith in the wrong person, Severus.</p>
<p>Rather like you.</p>
<p>The boy survives.</p>
<p>He doesn't need protection,</p>
<p>the Dark Lord has gone.</p>
<p>The Dark Lord will return.</p>
<p>And when he does, the boy</p>
<p>will be in terrible danger!</p>
<p>He has her eyes.</p>
<p>If you truly loved her...</p>
<p>No one, can know.</p>
<p>I shall never reveal the best of you,</p>
<p>Severus.</p>
<p>Your word?</p>
<p>Can you risk your life every day</p>
<p>to protect the boy?</p>
<p>... He possesses no measurable talent, his arrogance rivals that of his father's and he seems to relish in his fame... </p>
<p>Don't tell a word against my father!</p>
<p>James Potter, lazy, arrogant.</p>
<p>My father was a great man!</p>
<p>Your father was a swine!</p>
<p>Drink it, it will contain the curse to</p>
<p>your hand, for the time being.</p>
<p>It will spread, Albus.</p>
<p>How long?</p>
<p>Maybe a year.</p>
<p>Don't ignore me, Severus.</p>
<p>We both know Lord Voldemort has ordered</p>
<p>the Malfoy boy to murder me.</p>
<p>But should he fail, I should presume</p>
<p>the Dark Lord will turn to you.</p>
<p>You must be the one to kill me, Severus.</p>
<p>It is the only way.</p>
<p>Only then, will the Dark Lord trust you completely.</p>
<p>There will come a time, when Harry Potter,</p>
<p>must be told something.</p>
<p>But you must wait, until Voldemort is at his most vulnerable.</p>
<p>Must be told what?</p>
<p>On the night Lord Voldemort went</p>
<p>to Godric's Hollow to kill Harry...</p>
<p>Then, Lily Potter cast herself between them...</p>
<p>...the curse rebounded.</p>
<p>When that happens, a part of Voldemort's soul...</p>
<p>latched itself onto the only living thing it could find...</p>
<p>Harry himself.</p>
<p>There's a reason Harry can speak with snakes...</p>
<p>There's a reason he can look into Lord Voldemort's mind...</p>
<p>A part of Voldemort lives inside him.</p>
<p>So, when the time comes...</p>
<p>...the boy must die?</p>
<p>Yes... yes.</p>
<p>He must die.</p>
<p>You've kept him alive, so he can</p>
<p>die at the proper moment?</p>
<p>You've been raising him like a pig for slaughter.</p>
<p>Don't tell me now, that you've</p>
<p>grown to care for the boy.</p>
<p>Expecto Patronum</p>
<p>Lily!</p>
<p>After all this time!</p>
<p>Always.</p>
<p>So, when the time comes...</p>
<p>...the boy must die?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>He must die.</p>
<p>And Voldemort himself must do it.</p>
<p>That is essential.</p>
<p>Where've you been?</p>
<p>I thought you went to the forest.</p>
<p>I'm going there now.</p>
<p>Are you mad?</p>
<p>No...</p>
<p>You can't give yourself up to him.</p>
<p>What is it, Harry?</p>
<p>What is it you know?</p>
<p>There is a reason I can hear them.</p>
<p>The Horcruxes.</p>
<p>I think I've known for a while.</p>
<p>And I think you have, too.</p>
<p>I'll go with you.</p>
<p>No, kill the snake.</p>
<p>Kill the snake, and it's just him!</p>
<p>I'm ready to die.</p>
<p>Resurrection Stone.</p>
<p>You've been so brave, sweetheart.</p>
<p>Why are you here?</p>
<p>All of you.</p>
<p>We never left.</p>
<p>Does...</p>
<p>Does it hurt?</p>
<p>Dying?</p>
<p>Quicker than falling asleep.</p>
<p>You're nearly there, son.</p>
<p>I'm sorry.</p>
<p>I never wanted any of you to die for me.</p>
<p>And, Remus, your son?</p>
<p>Others will tell him what his</p>
<p>mother and father died for.</p>
<p>One day, he'll understand.</p>
<p>You'll stay with me?</p>
<p>Until the end.</p>
<p>And he won't be able to see you?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>We're here, you see.</p>
<p>Stay close to me.</p>
<p>Always.</p>
<p>No sign of him, My Lord.</p>
<p>I thought he'd come.</p>
<p>Harry, no!</p>
<p>What're yeh doin' 'ere?</p>
<p>Quiet!</p>
<p>Harry Potter...</p>
<p>...The Boy Who Lived...</p>
<p>...come to die.</p>
<p>Avada Kedavra</p>
<p>You can't help...</p>
<p>Harry, you're a wonderful boy...</p>
<p>You brave, brave man!</p>
<p>Let us walk.</p>
<p>Professor, what is that?</p>
<p>Something beyond either of our help.</p>
<p>A part of Voldemort sent here to die.</p>
<p>And exactly where are we?</p>
<p>I was gonna ask you that.</p>
<p>Where would you say where we are?</p>
<p>Well, it looks like King's Cross station.</p>
<p>Only cleaner...</p>
<p>...and without all the trains.</p>
<p>King's Cross, is that right?</p>
<p>This is as they say, 'your' party.</p>
<p>I expect you now realize that you and Voldemort...</p>
<p>...have been connected by something other than fate.</p>
<p>Since that night at Godric's Hollow all those years ago.</p>
<p>So it's true then, sir.</p>
<p>A part of him lives within me, doesn't it?</p>
<p>Did.</p>
<p>It's been just destroyed many moments</p>
<p>ago by none other than Voldemort himself.</p>
<p>You, were the Horcrux he</p>
<p>never meant to make, Harry.</p>
<p>I have to go back, haven't I?</p>
<p>Oh, that's up to you.</p>
<p>I've a choice?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah!</p>
<p>We're in King's Cross, you say.</p>
<p>I think if so decide,</p>
<p>you'll be able to board a train.</p>
<p>And where will it take me?</p>
<p>On.</p>
<p>Voldemort has the Elder Wand?</p>
<p>True.</p>
<p>And the snake is still alive?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And I've nothing to kill it with?</p>
<p>Help will always be given at Hogwarts, Harry.</p>
<p>To those who ask for it.</p>
<p>I've always pride of myself</p>
<p>on my ability to turn a phrase.</p>
<p>Words are, in my not so humble opinion...</p>
<p>..almost inexhaustible source of magic.</p>
<p>Capable of inflicting</p>
<p>injury and remedies.</p>
<p>But I would in this case...</p>
<p>amend my original statement to this:</p>
<p>Help, will always be given at Hogwarts,</p>
<p>To those who deserve it.</p>
<p>Do not pity the dead, Harry...</p>
<p>Pity the living.</p>
<p>And above all...</p>
<p>...all those who live without love.</p>
<p>Professor, my mother's Patronus...</p>
<p>was a doe, wasn't it?</p>
<p>As the same as Professor Snape's.</p>
<p>It's curious, don't you think?</p>
<p>Actually, if I think about it...</p>
<p>...it doesn't seem curious at all!</p>
<p>I'll be going now, Harry.</p>
<p>Professor?</p>
<p>Is this all real?</p>
<p>Or is it just happening inside my head?</p>
<p>Of course it's happening</p>
<p>inside your head, Harry.</p>
<p>Why should that mean, that it's not real?</p>
<p>Professor?</p>
<p>What should I do?</p>
<p>Professor!</p>
<p>My Lord, My Lord...</p>
<p>Are you hurt?</p>
<p>I don't need your help.</p>
<p>The boy...</p>
<p>Is he dead?</p>
<p>Is he alive?</p>
<p>Draco, is he alive?</p>
<p>Dead.</p>
<p>Who is that?</p>
<p>Hagrid's carrying?</p>
<p>Neville, who is it?</p>
<p>Harry Potter...</p>
<p>... is dead!</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>Silence!</p>
<p>Stupid girl!</p>
<p>Harry Potter...</p>
<p>is dead!</p>
<p>From this day forth...</p>
<p>...you'll put your faith in me.</p>
<p>Harry Potter is dead!</p>
<p>And now it's the time to declare yourself.</p>
<p>Come forward and join us...</p>
<p>or die!</p>
<p>Draco!</p>
<p>Draco.</p>
<p>Draco.</p>
<p>Come.</p>
<p>Well done, Draco.</p>
<p>Well done!</p>
<p>Well, I must say I'd hope for better.</p>
<p>And who might you be, young man?</p>
<p>Neville Longbottom.</p>
<p>Well, Neville, I'm sure we can</p>
<p>find a place for you in our rank.</p>
<p>I'd like to say something.</p>
<p>Well, Neville, I'm sure we'd all be</p>
<p>fascinated to hear what you have to say.</p>
<p>Doesn't matter that Harry is gone.</p>
<p>Stand down, Neville!</p>
<p>People die everyday!</p>
<p>Friends, family.</p>
<p>Yeah...</p>
<p>We lost Harry tonight.</p>
<p>He's still with us.</p>
<p>In here.</p>
<p>So as Fred, Remus...</p>
<p>Tonks...</p>
<p>All of them.</p>
<p>They didn't die in vain.</p>
<p>But you will.</p>
<p>Because you're wrong!</p>
<p>Harry's heart did beat for us.</p>
<p>For all of us!</p>
<p>It's not over!</p>
<p>Confringo</p>
<p>Come on!</p>
<p>All remain into the castle.</p>
<p>We have to kill the snake.</p>
<p>Hey, Neville!</p>
<p>Not my daughter, you bitch!</p>
<p>Hey, you were right...</p>
<p>...when you told Professor Snape</p>
<p>that wand was failing you.</p>
<p>It was always fail...</p>
<p>I killed Snape!</p>
<p>Yeah, but what if the wand never belonged to Snape?</p>
<p>What if its allegiance has always been</p>
<p>with someone else?</p>
<p>Oh, come on, Tom...</p>
<p>Let's finish it the way we started.</p>
<p>Together!</p>
<p>Die!</p>
<p>Harry!</p>
<p>Why didn't it work for him?</p>
<p>The Elder Wand?</p>
<p>It answers to somebody else.</p>
<p>When he killed Snape, he thought</p>
<p>the wand would become his.</p>
<p>But the thing is...</p>
<p>The wand never belongs to Snape.</p>
<p>It was Draco who disarmed Dumbledore</p>
<p>that night in the Astronomy tower.</p>
<p>From that moment on, the wand answered him.</p>
<p>Until, the other night when I disarmed Draco.</p>
<p>At Malfoy Manor.</p>
<p>So, that means...</p>
<p>It's mine!</p>
<p>What should we do with it?</p>
<p>We?</p>
<p>Just saying, that's the Elder Wand.</p>
<p>The most powerful wand in the world.</p>
<p>With that, he'll be invincible.</p>
<p>Together.</p>
<p>Bag?</p>
<p>Yeah</p>
<p>Jumper?</p>
<p>I'm gonna miss you.</p>
<p>Here they come.</p>
<p>Dad?</p>
<p>What if I am put in Slytherin?</p>
<p>Albus Severus Potter.</p>
<p>You're named after two Headmasters of Hogwarts.</p>
<p>One of them was a Slytherin.</p>
<p>And he was the bravest man I've ever known.</p>
<p>What you say if I am...</p>
<p>Then Slytherin house...</p>
<p>will've gained a wonderful young wizard.</p>
<p>Listen...</p>
<p>If it really means that much to you,</p>
<p>you can choose Gryffindor.</p>
<p>The Sorting Hat takes</p>
<p>your choice into account.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Really.</p>
<p>Ready?</p>
<p>Ready.</p>
