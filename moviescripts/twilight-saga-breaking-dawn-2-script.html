<h2>The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 2</h2>
<p>(Bella wakes up as a new vampire and she immediately notices the differences in her senses, noticing dust particles in the air, the textures and details of things in the room, she focuses on Edward and they start touching each other lightly, Edward strokes her face)</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: So beautiful. We're the same temperature now.</p>
<p>(Bella looks at herself in the mirror, then turns to Edward and embraces him, not realizing her newly found strength as Edward starts feels uncomfortable in her embrace)</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Hey, Bella, you're a lot stronger than I am right now. It's your turn not to break me. BELLA: I love you.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: I love you.</p>
<p>(They start kissing, then Bella looks at Edward)</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Renesmee.</p>
<p>(Edward smiles.)</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: She's incredible.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Where is she? I have to see her.</p>
<p>(Bella turns to go)</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Wait. Wait. You need to get your thirst under control.</p>
<p>(Bella starts to look hungry)</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Yeah, you'll need to hunt.</p>
<p>(Edward and Bella go to the woods on a hunt, as they run at super speed Bella again starts to notice everything in the woods, finally they stop after jumping over a waterfall)</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Close your eyes.</p>
<p>(Bella closes her eyes and turns)</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: What do you hear?</p>
<p>(Bella starts hearing an owl, a squirrel and then a dear, she goes over to look at the dear when she sees a human in the distance and starts smelling his blood as he hurts himself as he climbs the mountain, Bella looks like she's about to attack when Edward intervenes)</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Bella, don't!</p>
<p>(Bella bolts and starts running towards the human, Edward catches up with her and stops her as she's about to attack)</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Bella, stop! I'm sorry, I didn't realize there'd be people this far from the trails.</p>
<p>(Bella looks at the human and tries to control herself)</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: I have to get outta here.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Okay, I can help you.</p>
<p>(Bella jumps off the cliff and Edward looks at her as she leaps off and smiles)</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Or not.</p>
<p>(Bella goes to catch the dear but a mountain lion comes up and leaps towards the dear at the same time Bella jumps and takes down the mountain lion, the dear runs off)</p>
<p>(After Bella has fed on the mountain lion Bella and Edward walk back to the house)</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: (Chuckles) Well, I'm amazed. You ran away from human blood mid-hunt. Even mature vampires have problems with that.</p>
<p>(Bella sees Jacob walking out of the house and coming towards them)</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: You're still here.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: So are you. I didn't expect you to seem so you.</p>
<p>(Bella smiles)</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: Except for the creepy eyes.</p>
<p>(As Jacob starts getting closer)</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: I would keep my distance for now.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: It's safer for the baby to see how you do with me first.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Since when do you care about Renesmee?</p>
<p>(Jacob and Edward look at each other, knowing that Bella doesn't know that Jacob has imprinted on Renesmee)</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: All right. Take a whiff.</p>
<p>(Bella steps closer and takes a sniff)</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Well, I can see what everyone's been talking about.</p>
<p>(Jacob smiles)</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Jake, you really do stink.</p>
<p>(Edward and Jacob laugh)</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: You guys really look great together.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Want to come meet our daughter?</p>
<p>(Jacob runs ahead into the house as Bella and Edward make their way into the house)</p>
<p>(As Bella and Edward walk into the house, the whole family are there with Renesmee, they turn to face Bella)</p>
<p><strong>Esme</strong>: Welcome to the family.</p>
<p><strong>Alice</strong>: You look amazing, Bella.</p>
<p><strong>Carlise</strong>: Someone's been waiting to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Rose.</p>
<p>(Rose is holding Renesmee, turns to face them, Bella finally sees Renesmee, who looks a few months old, Rose hands over Renesmee to Bella and Renesmee tenderly touches Bella's face, Bella starts seeing image of herself when she gave birth to Renesmee)</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: What was that?</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: She showed you the first memory she has of you.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Showed me? How?</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: How do I hear thoughts? How does Alice see the future? She's gifted.</p>
<p>(Bella notices how much older Renesmee looks for a new born baby)</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: I've only been out for two days?</p>
<p><strong>Carlisle</strong>: Her growth rate is unprecedented.</p>
<p>(As Bella is holding onto Renesmee, Jacob starts to act protective)</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: All right. That's enough experimenting for one day.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Jacob. She's doing great.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: Yeah. Let's not push it though.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: What's your problem?</p>
<p><strong>Rosalie</strong>: Oh. Do tell her, Jacob.</p>
<p><strong>Emmett</strong>: This should be good.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Hold on a second.</p>
<p>(Edward takes Renesmee from her)</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: Bella. Look, it's a wolf thing.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: What's a wolf thing?</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: Um... You know we have no control over it. We can't choose who it happens with. And it doesn't mean what you think, Bella. I promise.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Take Renesmee out of the room.</p>
<p>(Bella starts to look angry, Edwards comes up behind her and touches her shoulder)</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Edward, don't touch me right now. I don't want to hurt you.</p>
<p>(Edward takes his hand away, furious with Jacob, Bella grabs hold of him and throws him out of the house)</p>
<p>(After throwing Jacob out of the house)</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: You imprinted on my daughter?</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: It wasn't my choice!</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: She's a baby!</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: It's not like that. You think Edward would let me live if it was?</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: I'm still debating it.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: I've held her once! One time, Jacob! And already you think that you have some moronic wolfy claim on her? She's mine!</p>
<p>(Bella suddenly strikes Jacob hard in the face and Leah and Seth in their wolf form arrive on the scene)</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: It's fine, Leah.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: You're gonna stay away from her.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: You know I can't do that.</p>
<p>(Bella punches Jacob hard in the stomach and he falls down)</p>
<p><strong>Esme</strong>: Stop her, Edward.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: He said it's fine. She's amazing, right?</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: Do you remember how much you wanted to be around me 3 days ago? That's gone now, right?</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Long gone.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: Because it was her. From the beginning it was Nessie who wanted me there.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Nessie? You nicknamed my daughter after the Loch Ness monster?</p>
<p>(As Bella moves towards Jacob in anger, Seth in his wolf form attacks her, but Bella pushes him aside easily and he hits the tree before falling to the ground in pain)</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: Seth, are you okay?</p>
<p>(Seth whimpers in pain)</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Seth, I'm sorry.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: He'll be all right.</p>
<p>(Jacob turns to Bella again)</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: Bella, you know me better than anyone. All I want is for Ness...</p>
<p>(He sees Bella get angry at the mention of her nickname)</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: Renesmee to be safe. Happy. Look, nothing ever made sense before. You. Me. Any of it. And now I understand why. This was the reason.</p>
<p>(Back at the house, as Jacob sleeps on the couch, Bella and Edward watch from the window as the Cullen's come back after their hunt, Rosalie comes into the house first looking at Renesmee in Bella's arms)</p>
<p><strong>Rosalie</strong>: Finally. My turn.</p>
<p>(Bella gives Renesmee to Rosalie)</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Where does she sleep?</p>
<p><strong>Rosalie</strong>: In my arms. Or Edward's or Esme's.</p>
<p>(Jacob wakes up as the other enter the house, Alice walks up to Bella)</p>
<p><strong>Alice</strong>: Happy birthday.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: I stopped aging three days ago.</p>
<p><strong>Alice</strong>: Well, we're celebrating anyway. So suck it up.</p>
<p>(Alice holds out a key for Bella)</p>
<p>(Alice takes Bella to her surprise present)</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: I still hate surprises. That hasn't changed.</p>
<p><strong>Alice</strong>: You'll love this one. Welcome home!</p>
<p>(Bella sees a house, which is near the Cullen's house)</p>
<p><strong>Alice</strong>: We thought you guys might like a place of your own.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: I think it's perfect.</p>
<p><strong>Alice</strong>: Go inside.</p>
<p>(Edwards takes Bella's hand and they walk towards their house)</p>
<p><strong>Alice</strong>: Have fun.</p>
<p>(Edward and Bella enter their new home and Edward shows Bella around)</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: This will be Renesmee's room.</p>
<p>(They walk towards their room which has a massive walk-in closet)</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Closet.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Wow.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Alice stocked it for you.</p>
<p>(Bella looks at the expensive dresses)</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Clearly.</p>
<p>(Bella walks into their bedroom and looks at their bed)</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: This is our room.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Vampires don't sleep.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: It's not intended for sleep.</p>
<p>(Edward starts kissing her neck, Bella pushes Edward onto the bed and they start making love)</p>
<p>(As they lie in each other arms after making love)</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: You really were holding back before. I'm never gonna get enough of this. We don't get tired. We don't have to rest or catch our breath or eat. I mean, how are we gonna stop?</p>
<p>(Edward smiles)</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Rosalie and Emmett were so bad, it took a solid decade before we could stand to be within five miles of them.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: I think we might be worse.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Definitely worse.</p>
<p>(They start kissing and making love again)</p>
<p>(The next morning, Bella and Edward walk into the Cullen's house)</p>
<p><strong>Emmett</strong>: Wow. Done already?</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Where's Renesmee?</p>
<p><strong>Emmett</strong>: Blondie stole her.</p>
<p>(Jacob watches Rosalie from the window as she plays with Renesmee)</p>
<p><strong>Emmett</strong>: Break a lot of stuff?</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Emmett. No.</p>
<p>(Emmett laughs)</p>
<p>(As the Cullen's phone rings)</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Is that Charlie?</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: He's been calling twice a day.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: He's in pretty rough shape.</p>
<p><strong>Carlisle</strong>: Eventually, we'll have to tell him you didn't make it.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: He needs to mourn, Bella.</p>
<p>(Jacob nods his head in agreement)</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Okay. We'll do it tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>Emmett</strong>: I'm gonna miss this place.</p>
<p><strong>Carlisle</strong>: We'll come back. We always do.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: Wait. Nobody said anything about leaving.</p>
<p><strong>Carlisle</strong>: Once people believe Bella's dead, we can't risk anyone seeing her.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: So you just disappear?</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Jacob, we don't have another choice.</p>
<p>(Upset at the prospect of losing Renesmee, Jacob goes to see Charlie)</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Hey. You heard anything?</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: Charlie, Bella is... Uh...</p>
<p>(Thinking that he means' Bella's dead)</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: No, she's not.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: No, no, no, I mean, she's fine. She's back home and she's feeling better.</p>
<p>(Charlie looks relieved)</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Why didn't you say so? That's great.</p>
<p>(Charlie starts walking off)</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: Wait. There's something you need to see first.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: I need to see Bella.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: Look, in order for Bella to get better, she had to change.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: What do you mean, "change"?</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: Here goes nothing.</p>
<p>(Jacob takes off his jacket and starts taking his clothes off)</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: What the hell are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: You don't live in the world you think you do.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Jacob, put your clothes on.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: Now, this may seem strange. Really strange. But stranger things happen every day. Trust me.</p>
<p>(Suddenly Jacob shifts into his wolf form in front of Charlie, who looks shocked)</p>
<p>(After telling the truth about himself to Charlie, Jacob defends himself to Bella and Edward)</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: Look, I solved a problem. You were leaving. What did you expect me to do?</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: You don't realize the danger you've put him in. The Volturi will kill anyone who knows about us.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: No, I didn't tell him about you. Just me. I only said you were different.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: And that we have a niece who we adopted.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: I mean, seriously, Jake, he's not just gonna let that go.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Did you consider the physical pain he'll put Bella through? It'll be like sticking a white hot branding iron down her throat. And that's assuming she can control her thirst.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: Look, Charlie's been in hell. And I know you'll be much happier with him in your life.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Jacob, don't try and pretend you're doing this for anyone but yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: Sorry you feel that way because he'll be here in 10 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: What?</p>
<p>(The Cullens help Bella get prepared to meet Charlie; Alice places contact lenses in her eyes)</p>
<p><strong>Alice</strong>: These will irritate your eyes at first.</p>
<p><strong>Carlisle</strong>: The main thing is not to move too fast.</p>
<p><strong>Esme</strong>: Try taking a seat. Crossing your legs.</p>
<p>(Bella gets up to take a seat, but she moves too fast and slams into the seat)</p>
<p><strong>Esme</strong>: Maybe a tad slower. Hmm.</p>
<p><strong>Alice</strong>: And blink at least three times a minute.</p>
<p>(Bella starts blinking repeatedly)</p>
<p><strong>Alice</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>Jaocb</strong>: For a cartoon character.</p>
<p><strong>Carlisle</strong>: Hold your breath. It will help with the thirst.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Just don't forget to move your shoulders so it looks like you're breathing.</p>
<p>(Bella starts moving her shoulders up and down)</p>
<p><strong>Rosalie</strong>: And don't sit so straight. Humans don't do that.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Okay. I got it. Move around, blink, slouch.</p>
<p>(Bella hears Charlie's car park up outside the house)</p>
<p><strong>Esme</strong>: Good luck.</p>
<p>(Everybody leaves the room)</p>
<p>(As Charlie walks up to the house, Carlisle opens the door)</p>
<p><strong>Carlisle</strong>: Hello, Charlie.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Where's Bella?</p>
<p>(Carlisle motions for Charlie to come inside and he takes Charlie to Bella, she's sat on the couch with Edward)</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Bella?</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Hi, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Never better. Healthy as a horse.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: You don't turn into an animal, too, do you?</p>
<p>(Bella smiles and shakes her head)</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: She wishes she was that awesome.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Let's give them some privacy.</p>
<p>(Edward, Carlisle and Jacob leave the room)</p>
<p>(After the others leave the room, Charlie sits next to Bella on the couch)</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Uh, Jake said that this... This was necessary. What does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: I really think it would be better...</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: I wanna know what happened to you.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: I can't tell you.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: I think I deserve an explanation.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: You do. But if you really need one, I can't stay here.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Oh, come on! No! No more going away!</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Dad, you're just gonna have to trust that for whatever reason, I'm all right. I'm more than all right. Can you live with that?</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Can I live with that? Well, I don't know, Bella. I mean, I just watched a kid I've known his entire life turn into a very large dog. My daughter looks like my daughter. But doesn't.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Can you please just believe that I'll tell you anything that you need to know?</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: And I don't need to know this?</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: No. Really, you don't.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Well... Not gonna lose you again. I can't.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Then you won't. I promise.</p>
<p>(Charlie hugs Bella)</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: I missed you, Bells. So much.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: I missed you, Dad.</p>
<p>(As Bella and Charlie are hugging, Edward walks into the room with Renesmee)</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Charlie. This is Renesmee.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Your niece?</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Our daughter.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Right. The adoption.</p>
<p>(Charlie looks at Renesmee for a moment)</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Renee-semee? She's got your eyes, Bella. Need to know, I guess.</p>
<p>(Bella nods her head and smiles)</p>
<p>(As they watch Charlie drive off)</p>
<p><strong>Jasper</strong>: Well done, Bella. Never seen a newborn show that kind of restraint.</p>
<p><strong>Emmett</strong>: I'm not sure she is a newborn. She's so tame.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Emmett, don't antagonize her. She's the strongest one in the house.</p>
<p><strong>Emmett</strong>: Please.</p>
<p>(This leads to an arm wrestling match in the woods between Bella and Emmett)</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Don't hurt yourself, Emmett.</p>
<p>(Bella and Emmett get into position)</p>
<p><strong>Jasper</strong>: All right. On 3. 3!</p>
<p>(Bella beats Emmett easily and everyone claps, Bella turns to Edward)</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Did you see that?</p>
<p>(Bella then punches the rock nearby making it break and crumble, showing off her new found strength)</p>
<p>(After her wrestling match with Emmett, Bella feels the sun coming up in the woods, she steps into the sunlight which makes her skin sparkle)</p>
<p><strong>Bella (V.O.)</strong>: My time as a human was over. But I never felt more alive. I was born to be a vampire.</p>
<p>(We see Sam making up with Jacob and Bella getting an expensive necklace with a note from the Volturi)</p>
<p><strong>Bella (V.O.)</strong>: Everything was falling into place. Even the Volturi seemed to accept my new status. Though they'd want proof eventually. It seemed we had only one enemy left. Time.</p>
<p>(We see Renesmee growing up from looking like a few months old to a few years old)</p>
<p><strong>Bella (V.O.)</strong>: Renesmee was growing too fast. We all worried about how long we would have with her. It just made every moment more precious.</p>
<p>(Renesmee, now looking at least 6 or 7 years old, is playing in the snow with Bella ad Jacob in his wolf form)</p>
<p><strong>Renesmee</strong>: Look, a snowflake.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: It's beautiful. Why don't you go get another one?</p>
<p>(Renesmee runs off to play as Bella and Jacob watch her)</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Edward thinks that we'll find answers in Brazil. There are tribes there that might know something.</p>
<p>(Bella watches Renesmee as she leaps into the air to catch snowflakes, suddenly they see a figure off in the distance watching them)</p>
<p><strong>Renesmee</strong>: Who was that?</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: I think that's our cousin from Denali. Irina!</p>
<p>(Looking visibly upset at seeing Renesmee, Irina and runs off before Bella can speak with her)</p>
<p>(Back at the house, after Carlisle has spoken to the leader of the Denali Coven)</p>
<p><strong>Carlisle</strong>: Tanya convinced lrina to come reconcile with us.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: It looks like she changed her mind.</p>
<p><strong>Esme</strong>: Seeing Jacob must have been too much for her.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Wish I could have just spoken to her.</p>
<p><strong>Carlisle</strong>: She's family. She'll come around.</p>
<p>(Edward, who's sat with Renesmee at the piano, starts playing the piano)</p>
<p>(In Italy we see Irina going to see the Volturi)</p>
<p><strong>Aro</strong>: What a pleasant surprise.</p>
<p><strong>Caius</strong>: What do you want? Hmm?</p>
<p><strong>Irina</strong>: I have to report a crime. The Cullens... They've done something terrible.</p>
<p><strong>Aro</strong>: Allow me, my dear.</p>
<p>(Aro takes Irina's hand, seeing that the Cullens have created an immortal child)</p>
<p><strong>Aro</strong>: Oh, my.</p>
<p>(Back at the Cullens house, everyone is gathered and listening to Edward play the piano when Alice has a vision of the Volturi coming to Forks to kill them all and drops the vase of flowers she was carrying)</p>
<p><strong>Jasper</strong>: What is it, Alice?</p>
<p><strong>Alice</strong>: The Volturi. They're coming for us. Aro, Caius, Marcus, the Guard. And lrina.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Honey, come here.</p>
<p><strong>Carlisle</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: What did lrina see in the woods?</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: We were just walking.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: Ness was catching snowflakes.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Of course. Irina thinks Renesmee's an lmmortal Child.</p>
<p>(Carlisle recounts the history of immortal children for Bella)</p>
<p><strong>Carlisle</strong>: The lmmortal Children were very beautiful. So enchanting. To be near them was to love them. But their development was frozen at the age they were turned. They couldn't be taught or restrained. A single tantrum could destroy an entire village. Humans heard about the devastation. Stories spread. The Volturi were forced to intervene. Since the Children couldn't protect our secret, they had to be destroyed.</p>
<p>(We see in flashback that Irina's mother was one of the creators of immortal children)</p>
<p><strong>Woman</strong>: No! (Screaming) No! No!</p>
<p><strong>Carlisle</strong>: Their creators grew very attached and fought to protect them. Long-established covens were torn apart. Countless humans slaughtered. Traditions, friends, even families. Lost.</p>
<p><strong>Woman</strong>: No, no! Mother!</p>
<p><strong>Woman</strong>: No! Mother!</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: So the Denalis' mother made an lmmortal Child?</p>
<p><strong>Carlisle</strong>: Yes. And she paid the price.</p>
<p>(We see the Volturi decapitate Irina's mother and burn the immortal child)</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Well, Renesmee's nothing like those children. She was born, not bitten. She grows every single day.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: So can't you just explain that to the Volturi?</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Aro has enough proof in lrina's thoughts.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: So we fight.</p>
<p><strong>Jasper</strong>: Their offensive weapons are too powerful. No one can stand against Jane.</p>
<p><strong>Alice</strong>: Alec's even worse.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Well, then we convince them.</p>
<p><strong>Emmet</strong>: They're coming to kill us, not to talk.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: No, you're right. They won't listen to us. But maybe others can convince them. Carlisle, you have friends all around the world.</p>
<p><strong>Carlisle</strong>: I won't ask them to fight.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Not fight. Witness. If enough people knew the truth, maybe we could convince the Volturi to listen.</p>
<p>(Esme turns to Carlisle)</p>
<p><strong>Esme</strong>: We can ask this of our friends.</p>
<p>(To Carlisle as they all pack to go and gather as many vampires as they can)</p>
<p><strong>Esme</strong>: At least we get to go to London again. We haven't been there in a long time.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: All right. Let's get this show on the road.</p>
<p>(Jacob sees Sam walking up the house; Sam gives Carlisle a note)</p>
<p><strong>Sam</strong>: Alice asked me to give you that. She and Jasper crossed our lands to the ocean last night.</p>
<p>(Carlisle reads the note and looks at the others)</p>
<p><strong>Esme</strong>: Carlisle?</p>
<p><strong>Carlisle</strong>: They've left us.</p>
<p><strong>Rosalie</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>Carlisle</strong>: She didn't say.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Can I see that?</p>
<p>(Carlisle gives Alice's note to Bella)</p>
<p><strong>Alice</strong>: Gather as many witnesses as you can before the snow sticks to the ground. That's when they'll come.</p>
<p>(Bella turns the note over and sees that it's a page torn from ‘The Merchant of Venice' by William Shakespeare)</p>
<p><strong>Bella (V.O.)</strong>: Alice's instructions were clear, but the question remained. Why would she and Jasper leave at the moment we needed them most? What did they know? Our search for witnesses began with a trip north to our closest relatives.</p>
<p>(Bella and Edward drive up to the Denali's house, Edward gets out of the car and walks up to them)</p>
<p><strong>Tanya</strong>: Edward, is everything all right? Why didn't you tell us you were coming?</p>
<p><strong>Carmen</strong>: Is it lrina? Have you heard from her?</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Not directly.</p>
<p><strong>Eleazar</strong>: Why is your bride waiting in the car?</p>
<p><strong>Kate</strong>: And why have you brought a wolf with you? I can smell him from here.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: My family is in danger. I need your help.</p>
<p><strong>Carmen</strong>: What's happened?</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: It's hard to explain but I need you to be open-minded. Can you do that?</p>
<p><strong>Tanya</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p>(Bella, Jacob and Renesmee wait in the car as Edward talks to the Denali's, Bella turns to Renesmee)</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Okay. Time to meet some new people.</p>
<p><strong>Renesmee</strong>: What if they don't like me?</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: They'll love you.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: They will. Once they understand you.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: They just haven't met anyone like you before.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p>(They all get out the car and the Denali's are immediately shocked at seeing Renesmee)</p>
<p><strong>Kate</strong>: The Volturi will come for all of us.</p>
<p><strong>Tanya</strong>: You get that thing out of here.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: She's not what she looks like.</p>
<p><strong>Tanya</strong>: This is a crime!</p>
<p>(Tanya suddenly attacks Edward and he quickly pushes her aside, Kate then attacks Edward but Bella quickly jumps in and throws Kate aside, then both Kate and Tanya move to attack Edward and Bella)</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Stay back!</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: She has blood in her veins. You can feel her warmth.</p>
<p><strong>Carmen</strong>: I can feel it.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: I'm her biological father. Bella is her mother.</p>
<p><strong>Kate</strong>: lmpossible.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: It's true. She was born while I was still human.</p>
<p><strong>Eleazar</strong>: I've never heard of such a thing.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: She can show you, if you let her.</p>
<p>(As Jacob brings Renesmee towards the Denali's)</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Tanya, you owe us this much. We're all under a death sentence because your sister didn't let us explain.</p>
<p>(Jacob brings Renesmee closer to Tanya, Renesmee goes to place her hand on Tanya's cheek)</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Don't be afraid. This is how she communicates.</p>
<p>(Renesmee touches Tanya's cheek, letting her feel her memories, Tanya suddenly understands and turns to her family)</p>
<p><strong>Tanya</strong>: It's true. She's not immortal.</p>
<p><strong>Bella (V.O.)</strong>: I knew the rest of our family would face this fear as well. Fear of the unknown. Fear of the Volturi.</p>
<p>(Carlisle and Esme visit another vampire family in Egypt)</p>
<p><strong>Carlisle</strong>: Amun, please!</p>
<p><strong>Amun</strong>: I cannot help you, Carlisle.</p>
<p><strong>Carlisle</strong>: I wouldn't ask if it weren't urgent.</p>
<p><strong>Amun</strong>: You must go.</p>
<p>(Suddenly Amun's son, Benjamin uses his powers to make the water in their small house pool rise up like a wall to block the doorway)</p>
<p><strong>Benjamin</strong>: I'd like to hear about it. I never get to meet any of Amun's friends. He likes to keep me hidden.</p>
<p><strong>Carlisle</strong>: I can't imagine why.</p>
<p>(Benjamin makes the water fall back into the pool, and he walks up to Carlisle and they shake hands)</p>
<p><strong>Carlisle</strong>: Carlisle.</p>
<p><strong>Benjamin</strong>: Benjamin.</p>
<p>(Back in Forks, we see Renesmee touching Benjamin's cheek, then Benjamin takes Renesmee's hand and uses his power to entertain her)</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Benjamin can influence the elements.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: And here I get super self-control.</p>
<p>(Suddenly they all hear something fast move in the woods getting closer to them, suddenly we see two female vampires appear out of nowhere)</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Who are they?</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Senna and Zafrina. From the Amazon.</p>
<p>(Bella and Edward take Renesmee to Senna and Zafrina)</p>
<p><strong>Bella (V.O.)</strong>: The arrival of Senna and Zafrina meant that our plea was being heard in even the most remote corners of the world while others searched for witnesses closer to home. A patriot Carlisle first met on the battlefield at Yorktown would become our most unlikely ally.</p>
<p>(We see Carlisle's friend, Garrett, for the first time, as he attacks a punk singing in the streets and holds him up by his throat)</p>
<p><strong>Garrett</strong>: Shut up! I hated the first British lnvasion. And I hate the second one even more.</p>
<p>(He starts to squeeze the punk's throat tighter)</p>
<p><strong>Emmett</strong>: Even the Beatles? Really, Garrett?</p>
<p><strong>Garrett</strong>: Old habits die hard.</p>
<p><strong>Rosalie</strong>: Carlisle needs you.</p>
<p>(Garrett lets go of the punk's throat and he drops to the ground and tries to crawl away)</p>
<p><strong>Garrett</strong>: Sounds interesting.</p>
<p><strong>Man</strong>: Help!</p>
<p><strong>Garrett</strong>: But first I'd better finish my meal.</p>
<p><strong>Man</strong>: Help me! Help!</p>
<p>(Garrett attacks the punk, drinks his blood and kills him)</p>
<p>(We see as the different vampire clans gather at the Cullens home)</p>
<p><strong>Bella (V.O.)</strong>: Each of them was won over. Each was made to see. Carlisle convinced his Irish friends to make the journey to Forks. Although we were grateful for their help, their thirst for human blood complicated the situation. The nomads Rosalie and Emmett sent were even more unpredictable. Especially Peter who had fought alongside Jasper as a newborn.</p>
<p>(As Jacob looks around the room at all the vampires)</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: Lotta red eyes around here.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: They agreed not to hunt in the area.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: But they'll feed somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>Bella (V.O.)</strong>: As more vampires set foot in their territory, more Quileutes turned. Their nature compelling them to join the pack.</p>
<p>(Jacob runs into a newly turned wolf in the woods)</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: Hey, easy there. Hey! It's all right. You're gonna be okay.</p>
<p><strong>Bella (V.O.)</strong>: Finally, Carlisle and Esme returned with our last witness.</p>
<p><strong>Carlise</strong>: How many came?</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Eighteen. You have some good friends.</p>
<p><strong>Esme</strong>: And Alice?</p>
<p>(Bella shakes her head indicating that Alice has still not returned, Esme hugs Bella)</p>
<p><strong>Alistair</strong>: We'll all be on Aro's list now. Centuries on the run. That's what you've brought me. Some friend, Carlisle.</p>
<p><strong>Carlisle</strong>: Alistair, come meet everyone.</p>
<p><strong>Alistair</strong>: I already told you, if it comes to a fight, I won't stand against the Volturi.</p>
<p><strong>Carlisle</strong>: It won't come to a fight.</p>
<p><strong>Alistair</strong>: I'll be in the attic.</p>
<p>(They watch as Alistair jumps up onto the roof and walks off)</p>
<p><strong>Esme</strong>: He's not a people person.</p>

<p><strong>Bella (V.O.)</strong>: We opened our home to 18 vampires. Many with gifts of their own. Zafrina had power over the mind. She could make anyone see what she wanted them to.</p>
<p>(Bella watches as Zafrina makes Edward see something in the forest)</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: If she weren't holding my hand right now, I could swear this was real.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: I don't see anything.</p>
<p><strong>Eleazar</strong>: Edward, you didn't tell me your wife is a shield.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: What's a shield?</p>
<p>(Edward suddenly understands and smiles)</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: The ones I've met are so different.</p>
<p><strong>Eleazar</strong>: It's a defensive talent.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: It's why I couldn't read your mind, even before. It's why Aro couldn't.</p>
<p><strong>Elezar</strong>: You have a very powerful gift.</p>
<p>(Suddenly Kate takes Bella's hand)</p>
<p><strong>Kate</strong>: Oh, yeah, she's a shield, all right. Shoulda put her on her ass.</p>
<p><strong>Garrett</strong>: Or your voltage has been exaggerated.</p>
<p><strong>Kate</strong>: Maybe it only works on the weak.</p>
<p>(Kate puts her hand up, daring Garrett to try and touch her)</p>
<p><strong>Carlisle</strong>: Garrett, I wouldn't.</p>
<p>(Garrett touches his finger to Kate's hand and he's instantly electrocuted and falls to the ground)</p>
<p><strong>Garrett</strong>: You are an amazing woman.</p>
<p>(Jacob is teaching some young Quileutes how to control themselves when they turn into wolves)</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: Now, you guys can do some serious damage. Which is why you'll need to control your phasing. If your mom pisses you off, you don't want to tear her head off.</p>
<p>(Suddenly Jacob stops as he hears something in the woods)</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: Whoever's coming wasn't invited.</p>
<p>(Jacob turns into a wolf and runs into the forest with the young wolves following him, they catch up and chase after two vampires who jump up some trees and then jump down and sit on some rocks mocking the wolves when Carlisle and the other vampire find them)</p>
<p><strong>Carlisle</strong>: Vladimir, Stefan, you're a long way from home.</p>
<p><strong>Kate</strong>: What are they doing here?</p>
<p><strong>Vladimir</strong>: We heard the Volturi were moving against you. But that you would not stand alone.</p>
<p><strong>Carlisle</strong>: We didn't do what we were accused of.</p>
<p><strong>Vladimir</strong>: We do not care what you did, Carlisle.</p>
<p><strong>Stefan</strong>: We have been waiting a millennium for the ltalian scum to be challenged.</p>
<p><strong>Carlisle</strong>: It's not our plan to fight the Volturi.</p>
<p><strong>Vladimir</strong>: Shame. Aro's witnesses will be so disappointed.</p>
<p><strong>Stefan</strong>: They enjoy a good fight.</p>
<p><strong>Eleazar</strong>: Aro's witnesses?</p>
<p><strong>Vladimir</strong>: Aww. Still hoping they'll listen?</p>
<p><strong>Eleazar</strong>: When Aro wants someone from a coven it's never long before evidence turns up proving that coven committed some crime.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: So he's done this before?</p>
<p><strong>Eleazar</strong>: It happens so rarely, I never realized it was a pattern.</p>
<p><strong>Carlisle</strong>: Apparently he always pardons one person whose thoughts he claims are repentant.</p>
<p><strong>Eleazar</strong>: This person always has an ability. And they're always given a place with the Guard.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: This is all about Alice. He has no one like her.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Which is why she left.</p>
<p><strong>Emmett</strong>: Why does he need witnesses?</p>
<p><strong>Alistair</strong>: To spread the word that justice has been served. After he slaughters an entire coven.</p>
<p><strong>Amun</strong>: Benjamin, Tia, we're leaving.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: And where will you go? What makes you think they'll be satisfied with Alice? What's to stop them from going after Benjamin next? Or Zafrina or Kate or anyone else with a gift? Anyone they want. Their goal isn't punishment, it's power. It's acquisition. Carlisle might not ask you to fight, but I will. For the sake of my family. But also for yours. And for the way you want to live.</p>
<p>(There's a moment of silence as the vampires look at each other, then Jacob stands)</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: The packs will fight. We've never been afraid of vampires.</p>
<p>(The Delani's stand)</p>
<p><strong>Tanya</strong>: We will fight.</p>
<p><strong>Garrett</strong>: This won't be the first time I fought a king's rule.</p>
<p><strong>Benjamin</strong>: We'll join you.</p>
<p><strong>Amun</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Benjamin</strong>: I will do the right thing, Amun. You may do as you please.</p>
<p><strong>Senna</strong>: We will stand with you.</p>
<p><strong>Siobhan</strong>: So will we.</p>
<p>(The other vampire start to step forward)</p>
<p><strong>Vladimir</strong>: That didn't take much.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Let's hope it doesn't come to that.</p>
<p><strong>Alistair</strong>: We'll see.</p>
<p><strong>Bella (V.O.)</strong>: Everyone showed courage. Though we knew that Aro's army was moving against us. Soon we would face the dark gifts of Jane. And worse, the paralyzing vapor of her brother Alec who could rob you of sight, sound and touch.</p>
<p>(In London, we see Jane and Alec chase down a Japanese vampire, Toshiro, they corner him and Alec releases his vapor, nearly killing him when Aro, Caius and Marcus arrive)</p>
<p><strong>Aro</strong>: Alec?</p>
<p>(Alec takes back his power, releasing Toshiro from his vapor, Aro moves closer to Toshiro)</p>
<p><strong>Toshiro</strong>: I will never go against you.</p>
<p><strong>Aro</strong>: Of course not, my dear Toshiro.</p>
<p>(Aro indicates that Toshiro gives him his hand, when he takes his hand Aro reads his mind)</p>
<p><strong>Aro</strong>: It seems Carlisle is still expecting you.</p>
<p>(Aro and the others turn and start walking off, leaving Alec and Jane to deal with Toshiro)</p>
<p><strong>Caius</strong>: Carlisle is all but ensuring his own destruction.</p>
<p><strong>Aro</strong>: Sad, isn't it?</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>[ CULLEN HOUSE ]</strong></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Aro will want us incapacitated before he attacks. Jane and Alec will try and take me out first because I can anticipate their moves.</p>
<p><strong>Garrett</strong>: Too bad we don't all have your shield.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Doesn't help me fight, though.</p>
<p><strong>Tanya</strong>: No, but you could help the rest of us, ifyou could project it.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>Tanya</strong>: I mean shield someone other than yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Is that possible?</p>
<p><strong>Carlisle</strong>: Gifts can be developed. Over time.</p>
<p><strong>Kate</strong>: At first, mine was just in my palms. Now I can radiate it all over my body.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: How do you do it?</p>
<p>(Bella takes Kate's hand, a little too hard)</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Tell me.</p>
<p><strong>Kate</strong>: Ow.</p>
<p>(Kate and the other vampire try to help Bella develop her power)</p>
<p><strong>Kate</strong>: You need to visualize it. See how it moves. What color it is. Now picture it expanding. Will it to go beyond you.</p>
<p>(Bella tries but only manages to bring up her shield for moment)</p>
<p><strong>Kate</strong>: I think she needs something to motivate her.</p>
<p>(Edward steps forward)</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: It's all right, I can take it.</p>
<p><strong>Garrett</strong>: He says that now.</p>
<p><strong>Emmett</strong>: Focus, Bella, or he's gonna be hurting.</p>
<p>(Edward puts his hand up ready to touch Kate's hand)</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Edward, I'm not ready to do this yet.</p>
<p>(Kate touches Edward hand, sending a painful electric shock through him)</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: I'm sorry. I said that I wasn't ready.</p>
<p><strong>Emmett</strong>: Dude, you're not motivating her.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: You want to try?</p>
<p>(Emmett puts his hands up and backs off)</p>
<p>(Bella tries again to use her power and Kate touches Edward, sending another electric shock through his body making Edward scream in pain)</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Kate!</p>
<p><strong>Kate</strong>: You seem to lack incentive. Shall I go see if Renesmee's awake?</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Are you crazy?</p>
<p><strong>Kate</strong>: All right. This one's on full power.</p>
<p>(As Kate is about to touch Edward, Bella manages to bring up her shield and protects Edward from Kate's power when she touches him)</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: It's painful, but it's bearable.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Okay, we should go again.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Emmett?</p>
<p><strong>Emmett</strong>: I'm good.</p>
<p>(Bella reads to Renesmee to sleep)</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: "There's sweet music here that softer falls than petals from blown roses on the grass. Or night dews on still waters between walls of shadowy granite in a gleaming pass. Music that brings sweet sleep down from the blissful skies."</p>
<p>(Bella sees that Renesmee has closed her eyes and she closes the book and turns off the light)</p>
<p><strong>Renesmee</strong>: Mom.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Hmm?</p>
<p><strong>Renesmee</strong>: Did Aunt Alice and Uncle Jasper run away because we're gonna die?</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: No. I think they left to keep us safer. That's what all these other people are here for, too. I'll never let anybody hurt you.</p>
<p>(Bella kisses Renesmee on her forehead and pulls her close to her)</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Come here. Go to sleep.</p>
<p>(After putting Renesmee to sleep, Bella goes to the living room and looks at Alice's not once more when Edward walks in)</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: It's strange. Physically, I feel like I could demolish a tank. Mentally, I just feel drained.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: How about a bath?</p>
<p>(Edward sits next to her and kisses her shoulder and starts unbuttoning her shirt)</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: I do remember how to undress myself.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Yeah, I just do it so much better.</p>
<p>(Bella smiles and looks at Alice's note again)</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Bella, I've had a bad habit of underestimating you. Every obstacle you've faced, I'd think you couldn't overcome it. And you just did. You're the reason they have something to fight for. My family.</p>
<p>(They kiss for a moment)</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: I'm gonna get the water running.</p>
<p>(Edward leaves the room, Bella looks at Alice's note again, turns the note over to look at the ripped page from The Merchant of Venice, she notices the book on the book shelf, opens it and finds a hidden note from Alice that says ‘J. Jenks, Seattle – destroy this')</p>
<p><strong>Bella (V.O.)</strong>: Alice made sure only I would get the message. Because only my mind would be safe from Aro.</p>
<p>(When Edward walks back in the room, Bella throws the book into the fire)</p>
<p>(Talking to Bella on the car as they take Renesmee to Charlie)</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: I'm surprised you took a break from Jedi training.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: If I don't take Renesmee to my dad, he'll come to us. Not so great.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: I know that's what you told Edward.</p>
<p>(Bella doesn't reply as she realizes that Jacob is aware she's up to something)</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: Whatever. I'm just glad to get away from all those reeking bloodsuckers.</p>
<p>(Bella gives Jacob a look of disapproval)</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: I'm sorry. I know. They're the good guys. But come on, Dracula One and Two are creepy.</p>
<p>(Both laughing)</p>
<p>(As Bella pulls up the car at Charlie's Renesmee quickly gets out of the car and runs towards Charlie and Sue as they come out of the house)</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: There she is. Come here.</p>
<p>(Charlie catches Renesmee in his arms and spins her)</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Oh! Wow! Look at you. You've grown half a foot! Seriously. Like 6 inches.</p>
<p><strong>Sue</strong>: Come on inside. Lunch is on the table.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: We got a tree to decorate, huh?</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: I've actually got a few errands to run, guys. I'll be back soon, okay?</p>
<p>(Jacob gives Bella a knowing look as she leaves and goes inside the house with Renesmee)</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Come on. Let's go.</p>
<p>(As Bella drives to Seattle to meet with J. Jenks)</p>
<p><strong>Bella (V.O.)</strong>: Alice's note gave me a new sense of hope. Maybe she had a plan for us after all. And maybe J. Jenks was the key.</p>
<p>(Bella arrives at the restaurant she's meeting Jenks an is directed to his table)</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: I'm meeting Mr. Jenks.</p>
<p><strong>Host</strong>: Right this way.</p>
<p><strong>Jenks</strong>: Mrs. Cullen.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>Jenks</strong>: I'm so happy you called. I always meet my private clients here. It's more comfortable than the office.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: And it's more public.</p>
<p>(Jenks smiles)</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: What type of work do you do, J.?</p>
<p><strong>Jenks</strong>: Oh, you know, this and that. It's always different, which keeps it interesting.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Have you known Alice and Jasper long?</p>
<p><strong>Jenks</strong>: I've been working with them for more than 20 years. And my late partner knew Jasper 15 years before that. He is, uh, unusually well-preserved.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Yes, he is.</p>
<p><strong>Jenks</strong>: I trust that Mr. Jasper is enjoying his vacation.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: He didn't tell you where he was going, did he?</p>
<p><strong>Jenks</strong>: No, no, no, he just mentioned that he was leaving when he came by to place his order.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: I assume that his order is ready?</p>
<p><strong>Jenks</strong>: Of course. I've never been late with a delivery.</p>
<p>(Jenks slides an envelope towards Bella, she opens the envelope to find forged passports and documentation for Renesmee and Jacob)</p>
<p><strong>Jenks</strong>: There a problem?</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: No. My husband and I thought that we'd all be traveling together.</p>
<p><strong>Jenks</strong>: Jasper said only two were traveling. His instructions were very clear.</p>
<p>(Bella clearly disappointed puts the passports and documents back into the envelope)</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: It's my mistake. Apparently, that's not going to happen.</p>
<p>(Driving back to Forks after her meeting with Jenks)</p>
<p><strong>Bella (V.O.)</strong>: Alice's vision was clear. Renesmee would have a future. But Edward and I wouldn't be a part of it.</p>
<p>(Bella watches as Renesmee goes to Edwards arms and he picks her up lovingly, she then goes and packs a bag for Renesmee, with some money and writes a letter for Renesmee)</p>
<p><strong>Bella (V.O.)</strong>: "My dearest Renesmee, I thought we would have forever together. But forever isn't as long as I'd hoped. I know now why Alice left me clues. It was to keep you safe. Everything you and Jacob will need is in this pack. Jacob will protect you. And he'll help you learn about the Ticuna legends. "</p>
<p>(As Bella finishes up writing her letter to Renesmee, Alistair walks into the room)</p>
<p><strong>Alistair</strong>: It's a romantic notion, isn't it? That a righteous few can defy a great evil. I must admit, you even had me believing. For a moment. (Chuckles) Well, good luck.</p>
<p>(Alistair turns and starts walking out)</p>
<p><strong>Alistair</strong>: You're gonna need it. Cheers.</p>
<p>(He walks out)</p>
<p>(Spending Christmas at Charlie's house, Bella watches the snow outside with worry, Edward walks up behind her)</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: The snow is sticking.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Hey, we still have today.</p>
<p>(Bella watches as Sue helps Charlie clear up in the kitchen)</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: I'm so glad Charlie found somebody to take care of him.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Bella, no one's giving up here.</p>
<p>(Charlie walks into the room)</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: All right! Present time! Let's go! Seth, Leah, stop eating. Jake, you start. Get it going.</p>
<p>(Jacob passes a present to Renesmee)</p>
<p><strong>Seth</strong>: What did you get me?</p>
<p><strong>Leah</strong>: I'm not giving you anything.</p>
<p><strong>Seth</strong>: Hey! No, come on, what did you get me?</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Well, Dad, we didn't have time to wrap yours, but here it is.</p>
<p>(She gives Charlie a piece of paper)</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: It's a 5-day fishing trip to Fraser River. It's for you and Sue.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: You leave tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Wow, that's really nice. Thank you. Tomorrow? I can't leave tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>Sue</strong>: I made arrangements for you at work.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Sneaky. And extravagant.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: And non-refundable, I'm afraid.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: You two trying to get rid of me?</p>
<p>(Bella and Edward go quite, thinking he might have figured out something is wrong)</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Because it's working! (Chuckles) Fraser River. That means we'll be chasing Cutthroat.</p>
<p><strong>Sue</strong>: We might even hook a Rainbow or some Bulls.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Woman knows her trout.</p>
<p>(Referring to the present Renesmee has just opened)</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Hey, beautiful. Let me see.</p>
<p>(She sees that it's a bracelet)</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Jacob make this for you? Wanna put it on?</p>
<p>(Bella puts the bracelet on Renesmee's wrist)</p>
<p><strong>Renesmee</strong>: It's so pretty.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: It is really pretty.</p>
<p>(Bella turns to Edward who smiles)</p>
<p>(As the snow is falling, the vampires and Jacob have set up camp in the woods, Jacob brings some wood and drops it on the ground, then Benjamin uses his powers to produce fire from his fingertips and throws it on the woods to start a fire)</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: That's what I'm talkin' about. A little pre-battle bonfire. Telling war stories.</p>
<p>(Jacob sits next to Benjamin and looks across the fire and sees the other vampires standing)</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: Or just standing there like frickin' statues.</p>
<p>(Suddenly Garrett spins in and sits next to them by the fire)</p>
<p><strong>Garrett</strong>: Name any American battle. I was there.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: Little Bighorn.</p>
<p><strong>Garrett</strong>: I came this close to biting Custer. But the lndians got him first.</p>
<p>(Just then Kate spins in and sits next to Garrett)</p>
<p><strong>Kate</strong>: Try Oleg's assault on Constantinople. He didn't win that one on his own.</p>
<p><strong>Liam</strong>: lfyou're talking battles, you're talking the Eleven Years' War. No one does rebellion like the lrish.</p>
<p><strong>Garrett</strong>: You lost the Eleven Years' War.</p>
<p><strong>Liam</strong>: Aye. But it was one hell of a rebellion.</p>
<p>(Sitting around the camp fire with the other vampires)</p>
<p><strong>Vladimir</strong>: When we ruled, everything came to us. Prey, diplomats, favor seekers. Such was our power. But we never put on white hats and called ourselves saints.</p>
<p><strong>Stefan</strong>: We were honest about what we were.</p>
<p><strong>Vladimir</strong>: We sat still for a very long time. We didn't notice we were beginning to petrify.</p>
<p><strong>Stefan</strong>: Perhaps the Volturi did us a favor when they burned our castles.</p>
<p><strong>Vladimir</strong>: We've been waiting 1,500 years to return that favor. We have been ready to do battle for ages.</p>
<p>(Watching the other vampires as they sit around the camp fire talking)</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: I can't help thinking, all these people are putting themselves in danger because I fell in love with a human.</p>
<p><strong>Carlisle</strong>: You found your mate. You deserve to be happy.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: But at what cost?</p>
<p><strong>Carlisle</strong>: Everyone here has something to fight for. I certainly do.</p>
<p>(Edward looks over at Bella and Renesmee in their tent)</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Carlisle, I've never thanked you. For this extraordinary life.</p>
<p>(Carlisle puts his hand on Edward shoulder as they stand and keep watching over the others)</p>
<p>(In their tent, Renesmee opens the locket containing a photo of Bella and Edward and the message ‘Plus que ma propre vie' engraved in it)</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: This means "More than my own life." That's how much I love you. Tomorrow I'm gonna need you to stay with Jacob. No matter what. Even if I tell him that... That he has to take you somewhere.</p>
<p>(Renesmee starts crying and Bella takes her into her arms)</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Hey. Baby, it's all right. You're gonna be safe. Always.</p>
<p>(When it is time for the Volturi to arrive, the Cullens and their witnesses, all gather are met in a large, snow-covered field, Garret stands next to Kate as they watch and wait)</p>
<p><strong>Garrett</strong>: If we live through this, I'll follow you anywhere, woman.</p>
<p><strong>Kate</strong>: Now you tell me.</p>
<p>(They hear the Volturi and their army getting closer)</p>
<p><strong>Garrett</strong>: The Redcoats are coming! The Redcoats are coming!</p>
<p>(Suddenly Aro and his army become visible and it's clear that they outnumber the Cullens and their witnesses, Edward watches Aro as they walk towards them)</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Aro's looking for Alice.</p>
<p>(As Aro and his army get closer, we see the wolf packs coming out to join the Cullens and their witnesses, Jacob in his wolf form comes and stands next Bella, Renesmee and Edward)</p>
<p>(Aro and his army stand in a line facing the Cullens and their witnesses, Carlisle walks forward)</p>
<p><strong>Carlisle</strong>: Aro, Iet us discuss things as we used to. In a civilized manner.</p>
<p><strong>Aro</strong>: Fair words, Carlisle. But a little out of place, given the battalion you've assembled against us.</p>
<p><strong>Carlisle</strong>: I can promise you, that was never my intent. No laws have been broken.</p>
<p><strong>Caius</strong>: We see the child. Do not treat us as fools.</p>
<p><strong>Carlisle</strong>: She is not an lmmortal! These witnesses can attest to that. Or you can look. See the flush of human blood in her cheeks.</p>
<p><strong>Caius</strong>: Artifice!</p>
<p><strong>Aro</strong>: I will collect every facet of the truth. But from someone more central to the story. Edward, as the child clings to your newborn mate, I assume you are involved.</p>
<p>(Edward looks at Bella then makes his way towards Aro, as Bella watches Edward walk towards Aro she uses her powers to shield Edward)</p>
<p>(As Edwards reaches Aro he extends his hand, Aro takes it and uses his power to read his thoughts and realizes that Renesmee is not an immortal child)</p>
<p><strong>Aro</strong>: I'd like to meet her.</p>
<p>(Edward turns and looks at Bella and Renesmee, then Bella, Renesmee, Jacob, joined by Emmett walk towards Aro)</p>
<p><strong>Aro</strong>: Ah. Young Bella. Immortality becomes you.</p>
<p>(Aro smiles and then shrieks with laughter as he hears Renesmee's heart beating)</p>
<p><strong>Aro</strong>: I hear her strange heart.</p>
<p>(Aro holds out his hand and Renesmee walks closer to him)</p>
<p><strong>Renesmee</strong>: Hello, Aro.</p>
<p>(Renesmee then touches Aro's cheek, using her powers on him, Aro becomes transfixed by what she shows him)</p>
<p><strong>Aro</strong>: Magnifico! Half mortal, half immortal. Conceived and carried by this newborn while she was still human.</p>
<p><strong>Caius</strong>: Impossible!</p>
<p><strong>Aro</strong>: Do you think they fooled me, brother?</p>
<p>(Bella, Edward and Renesmee walk back to join the other witnesses)</p>
<p><strong>Caius</strong>: Bring the informer forward.</p>
<p>(Irina is brought towards Caius and Aro)</p>
<p><strong>Caius</strong>: Is that the child you saw?</p>
<p><strong>Irina</strong>: I'm not sure.</p>
<p><strong>Caius</strong>: Jane.</p>
<p><strong>Irina</strong>: She's changed. This child is bigger.</p>
<p><strong>Caius</strong>: Then your allegations were false.</p>
<p><strong>Irina</strong>: The Cullens are innocent. I take full responsibility for my mistake. I'm sorry.</p>
<p>(Edward sees that Irina is about to execute)</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Caius, no!</p>
<p>(Felix then steps forward and hits Irina and snaps her head off)</p>
<p><strong>Tanya</strong>: Irina!</p>
<p>(Caius then sets fire to the rest of Irina's body, Kate and Tanya scream and run towards Aro and his army, Garrett gets hold of Kate, she uses her power to electrocute him, Edward then turns to Zafrina)</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Blind them.</p>
<p>(Zafrina uses her power to blind Kate and Tanya, stopping them from attacking)</p>
<p><strong>Tanya</strong>: We must attack!</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Tanya, this is what they want. Ifyou attack now, we'll all die.</p>
<p>(Edward then looks at Zafrina and she stops blinding Kate and Tanya)</p>
<p>(As Tanya and Kate stop their attack on Aro and his army, Jane looks at Edward)</p>
<p><strong>Jane</strong>: Pain.</p>
<p>(She uses her power to bring Edward down in pain, but Bella manages to use her power to shield Edward, he gets up and walks towards Bella)</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: It's working.</p>
<p>(Bella smiles as Jane realizes her powers are useless against her shield, then Alec steps forward and tries to use his deadly vapor but Aro stops him)</p>
<p><strong>Carlisle</strong>: Aro, you see there's no law broken here.</p>
<p><strong>Aro</strong>: Agreed. But does it then follow that there is no danger? For the first time in our history humans pose a threat to our kind. Their modern technology has given birth to weapons that could destroy us. Maintaining our secret has never been more imperative. In such perilous times, only the known is safe. Only the known is tolerable. And we know nothing ofwhat this child will become. Can we live with such uncertainty? Spare ourselves a fight today, only to die tomorrow.</p>
<p>(Just then two figures emerge from the nearby woods)</p>
<p><strong>Aro</strong>: HA!</p>
<p>(Edward realizes it's Alice and Jasper)</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Alice.</p>
<p><strong>Aro</strong>: Alice!</p>
<p>(As Alice and Jasper walk up to Aro and his army, two of Aro's guards stop them)</p>
<p><strong>Aro</strong>: My dear, dear Alice, we're so glad to see you here, after all.</p>
<p><strong>Alice</strong>: I have evidence the child won't be a risk to our kind.</p>
<p>(Aro looks at her with suspicion)</p>
<p><strong>Alice</strong>: Let me show you.</p>
<p>(Alice extends her hand, Aro motions for his guards to let Alice go)</p>
<p><strong>Caius</strong>: Brother?</p>
<p>(Alice walks up to Aro and he takes hold of her hand, as Aro reads her thought Alice realizes that Aro won't change his mind)</p>
<p><strong>Alice</strong>: It doesn't matter what I show you. Even when you see. You still won't change your decision.</p>
<p>(At that moment Alice turn, looks over to Bella and whispers)</p>
<p><strong>Alice</strong>: Now!</p>
<p>(Bella looks at Renesmee who's sitting on top of Jacob, then Bella looks at Jacob)</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Take care of my daughter.</p>
<p>(Jacob turns and starts running into the woods with Renesmee)</p>
<p>(To his guards, seeing Jacob running off into the woods with Renesmee)</p>
<p><strong>Caius</strong>: Get them. Hmm!</p>
<p>(Suddenly Alice attacks Aro, kicking him with her leg, sending him flying, but he manages to land back down and orders his guards to take hold of Alice)</p>
<p><strong>Aro</strong>: Take her away.</p>
<p>(The Cullens become angry as they see Alice being held)</p>
<p><strong>Carlisle</strong>: Let her go!</p>
<p>(Carlisle runs forward to attack, he and Aro meet each other mid-air, we then see Aro land on the ground with Carlisle's decapitated head in hand, the Cullens and their witnesses watch in horror as Caius burns Carlisle's body, this causes the Cullens, their witnesses and the wolf packs to launch into an attack, chaos breaks out with both sides undergoing deaths, Bella tries to use her power to help shield Jasper from Jane's power, but Alec attacks Bella, we then see Jasper writhe in pain from Jane's power and then beheaded by another Volturi, we then see Emmett rush in and behead Alec, then Seth is killed in his wolf form by a Volturi)</p>
<p>(As Jacob is running in the woods with Renesmee, we see one of Aro's guards catch up to them)</p>
<p><strong>Renesmee</strong>: Jacob! Jacob! Jacob! Jacob! Watch out!</p>
<p>(Just then a vampire jumps onto Jacob from above, but Jacob manages to kill and behead the vampire and he continues to run in the woods with Renesmee)</p>
<p>(Back at the battle scene, Benjamin uses his power to create a chasm in the earth, which kills many of the Volturi and nearly takes Esme and Edward down, but they manage to escape with Edward killing Felix in the process, then Alice attacks Jane and Bella helps by shielding her, Alice throws Jane to Sam in his wolf form and he kills her, we then see Caius join the battle then getting his skull ripped off by Tanya and Kate, we then see Vladimir and Stefan attack Marcus)</p>
<p><strong>Marcus</strong>: Finally.</p>
<p>(Vladimir and Stefan kill Marcus, as Aro watches most of his army die he finally joins in the battle and Edward and Bella attack him and together they manage to rip his head off and set fire to his body)</p>
<p>(As we see Aro die, we're suddenly transported back to the field before the battle and it's clear that the battle was a vision that Alice was showing Aro)</p>
<p><strong>Alice</strong>: Now you know. That's your future. Unless you decide on another course.</p>
<p><strong>Caius</strong>: We cannot alter our course. The child still poses a grave threat.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: But what if you were sure she could remain concealed from the human world? Could we leave in peace?</p>
<p><strong>Caius</strong>: Of course. But that cannot be known.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Actually, it can.</p>
<p>(We see two more witnesses, walking in from the woods, they come and stand next to Alice)</p>
<p><strong>Alice</strong>: I've been searching for witnesses of my own among the Ticuna tribes of Brazil.</p>
<p><strong>Caius</strong>: We have enough witnesses.</p>
<p><strong>Aro</strong>: Let him speak, brother.</p>
<p><strong>Nahuel</strong>: I am half human, half vampire. Like the child. A vampire seduced my mother, who died giving birth to me. My aunt Huilen raised me as her own. I made her immortal.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: How old are you?</p>
<p><strong>Nahuel</strong>: a hundred and fifty years.</p>
<p><strong>Aro</strong>: At what age did you reach maturity?</p>
<p><strong>Nahuel</strong>: I became full-grown seven years after my birth. I have not changed since then.</p>
<p><strong>Aro</strong>: And your diet?</p>
<p><strong>Nahuel</strong>: Blood, human food. I can survive on either.</p>
<p><strong>Marcus</strong>: These children are much like us.</p>
<p><strong>Caius</strong>: Regardless, the Cullens have been consorting with werewolves. Our natural enemies.</p>
<p>(Aro turns and addresses his army)</p>
<p><strong>Aro</strong>: Dear ones, there is no danger here. We will not fight today.</p>
<p>(Some of the Volturi look disappointed, including Caius and Jane, but they all listen to Aro and quickly leave, then before leaving Aro looks at Alice and Bella)</p>
<p><strong>Aro</strong>: Such a prize.</p>
<p>(Aro then turns and leaves)</p>
<p>(After Aro and his army leave)</p>
<p><strong>Vladimir</strong>: We have them on the run. Now is the time to attack.</p>
<p><strong>Carlisle</strong>: Not today.</p>
<p><strong>Stefan</strong>: You're all fools! The Volturi might be gone. But they will never forgive what happened here.</p>
<p>(The Cullens and their witnesses do not listen so Vladimir and Stefan leave in anger and everyone else rejoices in the fact that they did not have to fight the Volturi)</p>
<p>(Back at the Cullens house, the witnesses are saying goodbye and leaving, Edward and Jacob watch Renesmee as she speaks to Zafrina and Senna)</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: You have a beautiful family. She's gonna be around for a long time, isn't she?</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: A very long time. I'm glad she has you.</p>
<p>(Jacob smiles)</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: So should I start calling you "Dad"?</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: No.</p>
<p>(Jacob laughs, then Renesmee runs into Edwards's arms and Bella joins them)</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p>(Bella takes Renesmee's hand and puts it on her cheek to listen to Renesmee's thoughts)</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Yeah. We're all gonna be together now.</p>
<p>(As Renesmee hugs Bella, Alice watches them in the distance, she has a vision of Renesmee grown up, she's with Jacob and they are happy together and we also see Edward and Bella in the vision as they join Renesmee, then Alice looks at Edward and he smiles at her as he reads her thoughts seeing her vision of Renesmee grown up and happy)</p>
<p>(Last lines; Edward and Bella are back in their meadow)</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: I wanna show you something.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: What?</p>
<p>(Bella lifts her shield and shows Edward her thoughts and memories of their time together from the first time they met to everything that's happened to up to now)</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: How did you do that?</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Been practicing. Now you know. Nobody's ever loved anybody as much as I love you.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: There's one exception.</p>
<p>(Bella nods understanding that he feels the same for her and they kiss)</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Will you show me again?</p>
<p>(Bella smiles)</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: We've got a lotta time.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Forever.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Forever.</p>
<p>(Bella and Edward kiss and the movie ends with the final words from the novel being shown; ‘And then we continued blissfully into this small but perfect piece of our forever.')</p>
