<h2>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</h2>

						
							<p>Bloody kids.</p>
<p>How fastidious you've become, Wormtail.</p>
<p>As l recall, you once called the nearest gutter pipe home.</p>
<p>Could it be that the task of nursing me has become wearisome for you?</p>
<p>Oh, no. No, no, my Lord Voldemort.</p>
<p>l only meant. . . perhaps if we were to do it without the boy.</p>
<p>No! The boy is everything!</p>
<p>lt cannot be done without him.</p>
<p>And it will be done.</p>
<p>Exactly as l said.</p>
<p>-l will not disappoint you, my Lord.</p>
<p>-Good.</p>
<p>First, gather our old comrades.</p>
<p>Send them a sign.</p>
<p>Nagini tells me</p>
<p>the old Muggle caretaker. . .</p>
<p>. . .is standing just outside the door.</p>
<p>Step aside, Wormtail,</p>
<p>so l can give our guest a proper greeting.</p>
<p>Avada Kedavra!</p>
<p>Harry.</p>
<p>Harry!</p>
<p>Are you all right?</p>
<p>Hermione. Bad dream.</p>
<p>-When did you get here?</p>
<p>-Just now. You?</p>
<p>Last night.</p>
<p>Wake up! Wake up, Ronald!</p>
<p>Bloody hell.</p>
<p>Honestly, get dressed.</p>
<p>And don't go back to sleep.</p>
<p>Come on, Ron!</p>
<p>Your mother says breakfast's ready!</p>
<p>-Ron, where are we actually going?</p>
<p>-Don't know.</p>
<p>-Hey, Dad. Where are we going?</p>
<p>-Haven't the foggiest.</p>
<p>Keep up!</p>
<p>Arthur!</p>
<p>lt's about time, son.</p>
<p>Sorry, Amos. Some of us</p>
<p>had a bit of a sleepy start.</p>
<p>This is Amos Diggory, everyone.</p>
<p>Works with me at the Ministry.</p>
<p>And this strapping young lad</p>
<p>must be Cedric, am l right?</p>
<p>Yes, sir.</p>
<p>This way.</p>
<p>Merlin's beard!</p>
<p>You must be Harry Potter.</p>
<p>-Yes, sir.</p>
<p>-Great, great pleasure.</p>
<p>Pleasure to meet you too, sir.</p>
<p>Yes, it's just over there.</p>
<p>-Shall we?</p>
<p>-Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>We don't want to be late.</p>
<p>Come on. Nearly there now.</p>
<p>Get yourself into a good position.</p>
<p>Why are they all standing around</p>
<p>that manky old boot?</p>
<p>-That isn't just any manky old boot.</p>
<p>-lt's a Portkey.</p>
<p>Time to go!</p>
<p>What's a Portkey?</p>
<p>-Ready! After three. One, two. . .</p>
<p>-Harry!</p>
<p>. . .three!</p>
<p>Let go, kids!</p>
<p>-What?!</p>
<p>-Let go!</p>
<p>l'll bet that cleared your sinuses, eh?</p>
<p>-Total shambles, as per usual.</p>
<p>-Thanks.</p>
<p>Go on, look at that!</p>
<p>Well, kids, welcome to</p>
<p>the Quidditch World Cup!</p>
<p>Stay together! Keep up, girls!</p>
<p>Look!</p>
<p>Come on! Keep up, girls!</p>
<p>Blimey!</p>
<p>Parting of the ways, l think, old chap.</p>
<p>-See you at the match.</p>
<p>-See you.</p>
<p>-Cedric.</p>
<p>-Ced, come on.</p>
<p>See you later, Cedric.</p>
<p>Home sweet home.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>-Excellent, excellent.</p>
<p>-Ginny, look!</p>
<p>-All to the bath.</p>
<p>-Look.</p>
<p>Girls, choose a bunk and unpack.</p>
<p>Ron, get out of the kitchen.</p>
<p>We're all hungry.</p>
<p>-Yeah, get out of the kitchen, Ron!</p>
<p>-Feet off the table!</p>
<p>-Feet off the table!</p>
<p>-Feet off the table!</p>
<p>l love magic.</p>
<p>Get your Quidditch World Cup</p>
<p>programs here!</p>
<p>Blimey, Dad. How far up are we?</p>
<p>Well, put it this way:</p>
<p>lf it rains. . .</p>
<p>. . .you'll be the first to know.</p>
<p>Father and l are in</p>
<p>the minister's box. . .</p>
<p>. . .by personal invitation</p>
<p>of Cornelius Fudge himself.</p>
<p>Don't boast, Draco.</p>
<p>There's no need with these people.</p>
<p>Do enjoy yourself, won't you?</p>
<p>While you can.</p>
<p>Come on up. Take your seats. l told you</p>
<p>these seats would be worth waiting for.</p>
<p>Come on!</p>
<p>lt's the lrish! There's Troy!</p>
<p>-And Mullet!</p>
<p>-And Moran!</p>
<p>Ireland! Ireland! Ireland!</p>
<p>-Here come the Bulgarians!</p>
<p>-Yes!</p>
<p>Who's that?</p>
<p>That, sis, is the best Seeker</p>
<p>in the world.</p>
<p>Krum! Krum! Krum!</p>
<p>Krum!</p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p>Good evening!</p>
<p>As Minister for Magic. . .</p>
<p>. . .it gives me great pleasure. . .</p>
<p>. . .to welcome</p>
<p>each and every one of you. . .</p>
<p>. . .to the final</p>
<p>of the 422nd Quidditch World Cup!</p>
<p>Let the match. . .</p>
<p>. . .begin!</p>
<p>Krum! Krum! Krum!</p>
<p>There's no one like Krum.</p>
<p>-Krum?</p>
<p>-Dumb Krum?</p>
<p>He's like a bird,</p>
<p>the way he rides the wind.</p>
<p>-He's more than an athlete.</p>
<p>-Dumb Krum.</p>
<p>He's an artist.</p>
<p>-l think you're in love, Ron.</p>
<p>-Shut up.</p>
<p>Viktor, I love you</p>
<p>Viktor, I do</p>
<p>When we're apart</p>
<p>My heart beats only for you</p>
<p>Sounds like the lrish</p>
<p>have got their pride on.</p>
<p>Stop! Stop it!</p>
<p>lt's not the lrish.</p>
<p>We've gotta get out of here. Now!</p>
<p>Get out, it's the Death Eaters!</p>
<p>Get back to the Portkey, everybody,</p>
<p>and stick together!</p>
<p>Fred, George!</p>
<p>Ginny is your responsibility.</p>
<p>Go!</p>
<p>Harry!</p>
<p>-Keep up, you lot!</p>
<p>-Harry!</p>
<p>Harry! Harry!</p>
<p>Morsmordre!</p>
<p>Harry!</p>
<p>-Where are you?</p>
<p>-Harry!</p>
<p>We've been looking for you for ages!</p>
<p>Thought we lost you, mate.</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>Stupefy!</p>
<p>Stop!</p>
<p>That's my son!</p>
<p>-Ron, Harry, Hermione, you all right?</p>
<p>-We came back for Harry.</p>
<p>Which of you conjured it?</p>
<p>-Crouch, you can't possi--</p>
<p>-Do not lie!</p>
<p>You've been discovered</p>
<p>at the scene of the crime.</p>
<p>-Crime?</p>
<p>-Barty! They're just kids.</p>
<p>What crime?</p>
<p>lt's the Dark Mark, Harry.</p>
<p>lt's his mark.</p>
<p>What, Voldemort?</p>
<p>Those people tonight, in the masks,</p>
<p>they're his too, aren't they?</p>
<p>-His followers?</p>
<p>-Yeah.</p>
<p>Death Eaters.</p>
<p>-Follow me.</p>
<p>-There was a man, before.</p>
<p>There!</p>
<p>All of you, this way!</p>
<p>A man, Harry?</p>
<p>Who?</p>
<p>l don't know.</p>
<p>l didn't see his face.</p>
<p>Anything from the trolley?</p>
<p>Anything from the trolley?</p>
<p>Anything from the trolley, dears?</p>
<p>Packet of Drooble's. . .</p>
<p>. . .and a Licorice Wand.</p>
<p>On second thought, just the Drooble's.</p>
<p>-lt's all right, l'll get it. Don't worry.</p>
<p>-Just the Drooble's. Thanks.</p>
<p>Two Pumpkin Pasties, please.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Anything sweet for you, dear?</p>
<p>Oh, no, l'm not hungry. Thank you.</p>
<p>Anything from the trolley?</p>
<p>This is horrible.</p>
<p>How can the Ministry</p>
<p>not know who conjured it?</p>
<p>Wasn't there any security or. . .?</p>
<p>Loads, according to Dad.</p>
<p>That's what worried them so much.</p>
<p>Happened right under their noses.</p>
<p>lt's hurting again, isn't it?</p>
<p>Your scar.</p>
<p>l'm fine.</p>
<p>You know Sirius will</p>
<p>want to hear about this. . .</p>
<p>. . .what you saw at the World Cup</p>
<p>and the dream.</p>
<p>Hedwig. There we go.</p>
<p>Clear the runway!</p>
<p>Well, there's something</p>
<p>you don't see every day.</p>
<p>Well, now we're all settled in and sorted,</p>
<p>I'd like to make an announcement.</p>
<p>This castle will not only be</p>
<p>your home this year. . .</p>
<p>. . .but home to some</p>
<p>very special guests as well.</p>
<p>You see, Hogwarts has been chosen. . . .</p>
<p>Yes, what is it?</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>Tell them to wait.</p>
<p>Tell them to wait. Wait.</p>
<p>So Hogwarts has been chosen</p>
<p>to host a legendary event:</p>
<p>The Triwizard Tournament.</p>
<p>-For those of you who do not know. . .</p>
<p>-Brilliant.</p>
<p>. . .the Triwizard Tournament</p>
<p>brings together three schools. . .</p>
<p>. . .for a series of magical contests.</p>
<p>From each school, a single student</p>
<p>is selected to compete.</p>
<p>Now let me be clear.</p>
<p>lf chosen, you stand alone.</p>
<p>And trust me when l say. . .</p>
<p>. . .these contests are not</p>
<p>for the faint-hearted.</p>
<p>But more of that later.</p>
<p>For now, please join me in welcoming. . .</p>
<p>. . .the lovely ladies of the</p>
<p>Beauxbatons Academy of Magic. . .</p>
<p>. . .and their headmistress,</p>
<p>Madame Maxime.</p>
<p>Bloody hell.</p>
<p>Blimey. That's one big woman.</p>
<p>And now our friends from the north.</p>
<p>Please greet the proud sons</p>
<p>of Durmstrang. . .</p>
<p>. . .and their high master,</p>
<p>lgor Karkaroff.</p>
<p>Oh, it's Krum!</p>
<p>Blimey, it's him!</p>
<p>Viktor Krum!</p>
<p>Albus.</p>
<p>lgor.</p>
<p>Professor Dumbly-dorr,</p>
<p>my horses have traveled a long way.</p>
<p>-They will need attending to.</p>
<p>-Don't worry, Madame Maxime.</p>
<p>Our gamekeeper, Hagrid,</p>
<p>is more than capable of seeing to them.</p>
<p>But you know, Monsieur Hagrid. . .</p>
<p>. . .they drink only single-malt whiskey.</p>
<p>You idiot!</p>
<p>Your attention, please!</p>
<p>l'd like to say a few words.</p>
<p>Eternal glory.</p>
<p>That is what awaits the student</p>
<p>who wins the Triwizard Tournament.</p>
<p>But to do this, that student</p>
<p>must survive three tasks.</p>
<p>Three extremely dangerous tasks.</p>
<p>-Wicked.</p>
<p>-Wicked.</p>
<p>For this reason, the Ministry has seen fit</p>
<p>to impose a new rule.</p>
<p>To explain all this. . .</p>
<p>. . .we have the head of the Department</p>
<p>of lnternational Magical Cooperation. . .</p>
<p>. . .Mr. Bartemius Crouch.</p>
<p>Bloody hell. lt's Mad-Eye Moody.</p>
<p>-Alastor Moody? The Auror?</p>
<p>-Auror?</p>
<p>Dark-wizard catcher. Half the cells</p>
<p>in Azkaban are filled thanks to him.</p>
<p>He's supposed to be mad as a hatter,</p>
<p>though, these days.</p>
<p>-My dear old friend, thanks for coming.</p>
<p>-Stupid ceiling.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>What's that he's drinking,</p>
<p>do you suppose?</p>
<p>l don't know, but l don't think</p>
<p>it's pumpkin juice.</p>
<p>After due consideration. . .</p>
<p>. . .the Ministry has concluded that,</p>
<p>for their own safety. . .</p>
<p>. . .no student under the age of 1 7. . .</p>
<p>. . .shall be allowed to put forth their</p>
<p>name for the Triwizard Tournament.</p>
<p>-This decision is final.</p>
<p>-That's rubbish!</p>
<p>That's rubbish!</p>
<p>You don't know what you're doing!</p>
<p>-Silence!</p>
<p>-They're not too happy about that, then.</p>
<p>The Goblet of Fire.</p>
<p>Anyone wishing to submit themselves</p>
<p>to the tournament. . .</p>
<p>. . .need only write their name</p>
<p>upon a piece of parchment. . .</p>
<p>. . .and throw it in the flame before</p>
<p>this hour on Thursday night.</p>
<p>Do not do so lightly.</p>
<p>lf chosen, there's no turning back.</p>
<p>As from this moment,</p>
<p>the Triwizard Tournament has begun.</p>
<p>Alastor Moody.</p>
<p>Ex-Auror. . .</p>
<p>. . .Ministry malcontent. . .</p>
<p>. . .and your new</p>
<p>Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.</p>
<p>l am here because Dumbledore asked me.</p>
<p>End of story, goodbye, the end.</p>
<p>Any questions?</p>
<p>When it comes to the Dark Arts. . .</p>
<p>. . .l believe in a practical approach.</p>
<p>But first, which of you can tell me</p>
<p>how many Unforgivable Curses there are?</p>
<p>-Three, sir.</p>
<p>-And they are so named?</p>
<p>Because they are unforgivable.</p>
<p>The use of any one of them will--</p>
<p>Will earn you a one-way ticket</p>
<p>to Azkaban, correct.</p>
<p>The Ministry says you're too young</p>
<p>to see what these curses do.</p>
<p>l say different! You need to know</p>
<p>what you're up against!</p>
<p>You need to be prepared.</p>
<p>You need to find another place</p>
<p>to put your chewing gum. . .</p>
<p>. . .besides the underside of your desk,</p>
<p>Mr. Finnigan!</p>
<p>No way. The old codger</p>
<p>can see out the back of his head.</p>
<p>And hear across classrooms!</p>
<p>So which curse shall we see first?</p>
<p>-Weasley!</p>
<p>-Yes?</p>
<p>Stand.</p>
<p>Give us a curse.</p>
<p>Well, my dad did tell me about one.</p>
<p>The lmperius Curse.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, your father</p>
<p>would know all about that.</p>
<p>Gave the Ministry quite a bit of grief</p>
<p>a few years ago.</p>
<p>Perhaps this will show you why.</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>Lovely little beauty.</p>
<p>Engorgio.</p>
<p>Imperio!</p>
<p>Don't worry. lt's completely harmless.</p>
<p>lf she bites. . .</p>
<p>. . .she's lethal.</p>
<p>What are you laughing at?</p>
<p>Get off!</p>
<p>Talented, isn't she?</p>
<p>What should l have her do next?</p>
<p>Jump out the window?</p>
<p>Drown herself?</p>
<p>Scores of witches and wizards</p>
<p>have claimed. . .</p>
<p>. . .that they only did</p>
<p>You-Know-Who's bidding. . .</p>
<p>. . .under the influence</p>
<p>of the lmperius Curse.</p>
<p>But here's the rub:</p>
<p>How do we sort out the liars?</p>
<p>Another, another.</p>
<p>Up, up. Come on.</p>
<p>Longbottom, is it?</p>
<p>Up.</p>
<p>Professor Sprout tells me</p>
<p>you have an aptitude for herbology.</p>
<p>There's the. . . .</p>
<p>The Cruciatus Curse.</p>
<p>Correct, correct. Come, come.</p>
<p>Particularly nasty.</p>
<p>The torture curse.</p>
<p>Crucio!</p>
<p>Stop it! Can't you see</p>
<p>it's bothering him? Stop it!</p>
<p>Perhaps you could give us the last</p>
<p>Unforgivable Curse, Miss Granger.</p>
<p>No?</p>
<p>Avada Kedavra!</p>
<p>The Killing Curse.</p>
<p>Only one person is known</p>
<p>to have survived it. . .</p>
<p>. . .and he's sitting in this room.</p>
<p>Brilliant, isn't he?</p>
<p>Completely demented, of course, and</p>
<p>terrifying to be in the same room with. . .</p>
<p>. . .but he's really been there, you know?</p>
<p>He's looked evil in the eye.</p>
<p>There's a reason those curses</p>
<p>are unforgivable.</p>
<p>To perform them in a classroom. . . .</p>
<p>l mean, did you see Neville's face?</p>
<p>Neville?</p>
<p>Son?</p>
<p>You all right?</p>
<p>Come on. We'll have a cup of tea.</p>
<p>l want to show you something.</p>
<p>We're gonna be late!</p>
<p>Come on, Cedric. Put it in!</p>
<p>Eternal glory. Be brilliant, wouldn't it?</p>
<p>Three years from now,</p>
<p>when we're old enough to be chosen.</p>
<p>Yeah, rather you than me.</p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p>Thank you, thank you.</p>
<p>-Well, lads, we've done it.</p>
<p>-Cooked it up just this morning.</p>
<p>lt's not going to work.</p>
<p>-Oh, yeah?</p>
<p>-And why is that, Granger?</p>
<p>You see this? This is an Age Line.</p>
<p>Dumbledore drew it himself.</p>
<p>So?</p>
<p>So a genius like Dumbledore</p>
<p>couldn't possibly be fooled. . .</p>
<p>. . .by a dodge as pathetically dimwitted</p>
<p>as an Aging Potion.</p>
<p>-But that's why it's so brilliant.</p>
<p>-Because it's so pathetically dimwitted.</p>
<p>-Ready, Fred?</p>
<p>-Ready, George.</p>
<p>-Bottoms up.</p>
<p>-Bottoms up.</p>
<p>-Yes!</p>
<p>-Yes!</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p>Ready?</p>
<p>-Yes!</p>
<p>-Yes!</p>
<p>-You said!</p>
<p>-You said!</p>
<p>-Oh, right, you want a piece of me?!</p>
<p>-l'll tear your ears off!</p>
<p>-Now you're making me laugh.</p>
<p>-Take this! Come on!</p>
<p>Fight! Fight! Fight!</p>
<p>We're ''old school,'' right?</p>
<p>Yeah, but you look older!</p>
<p>Sit down. Please.</p>
<p>Now the moment</p>
<p>you've all been waiting for:</p>
<p>The champion selection.</p>
<p>The Durmstrang champion</p>
<p>is Viktor Krum.</p>
<p>The champion for Beauxbatons. . .</p>
<p>. . .is Fleur Delacour.</p>
<p>The Hogwarts champion,</p>
<p>Cedric Diggory!</p>
<p>Excellent! We now have</p>
<p>our three champions.</p>
<p>But in the end,</p>
<p>only one will go down in history.</p>
<p>Only one will hoist</p>
<p>this chalice of champions. . .</p>
<p>. . .this vessel of victory. . .</p>
<p>. . .the Triwizard Cup!</p>
<p>Harry Potter.</p>
<p>Harry Potter?</p>
<p>No. No.</p>
<p>Harry Potter!</p>
<p>Go on, Harry.</p>
<p>Harry, for goodness sake.</p>
<p>He's a cheat!</p>
<p>He's not even 1 7 yet!</p>
<p>-lt's wrong, l tell you!</p>
<p>-You French tart.</p>
<p>-Everything is a conspiracy theory!</p>
<p>-Quiet! l can't think!</p>
<p>-Everything is a conspiracy theory!</p>
<p>-l protest.</p>
<p>-Harry.</p>
<p>-l protest!</p>
<p>Did you put your name</p>
<p>in the Goblet of Fire?</p>
<p>-No, sir.</p>
<p>-Did you ask one of the older students. . .</p>
<p>-. . .to do it for you?</p>
<p>-No, sir.</p>
<p>-You're absolutely sure?</p>
<p>-Yes. Yes, sir.</p>
<p>-But of course he is lying.</p>
<p>-The hell he is!</p>
<p>The Goblet of Fire is an exceptionally</p>
<p>powerful magical object.</p>
<p>Only an exceptionally powerful</p>
<p>Confundus Charm could've hoodwinked it.</p>
<p>Magic way beyond the talents</p>
<p>of a fourth year.</p>
<p>You seem to have given this</p>
<p>a fair bit of thought, Mad-Eye.</p>
<p>lt was once my job to think</p>
<p>as dark wizards do, Karkaroff. . .</p>
<p>-. . .perhaps you remember.</p>
<p>-This doesn't help, Alastor.</p>
<p>Leave this to you, Barty.</p>
<p>The rules are absolute.</p>
<p>The Goblet of Fire constitutes</p>
<p>a binding magical contract.</p>
<p>Mr. Potter has no choice.</p>
<p>He is, as of tonight. . .</p>
<p>. . .a Triwizard champion.</p>
<p>This can't go on, Albus.</p>
<p>First the Dark Mark. Now this?</p>
<p>What do you suggest, Minerva?</p>
<p>Put an end to it.</p>
<p>Don't let Potter compete.</p>
<p>You heard Barty. The rules are clear.</p>
<p>Well, the devil with Barty</p>
<p>and his rules.</p>
<p>And since when did you</p>
<p>accommodate the Ministry?</p>
<p>Headmaster, l, too, find it difficult</p>
<p>to believe this mere coincidence.</p>
<p>However, if we are to truly discover</p>
<p>the meaning of these events. . .</p>
<p>. . .perhaps we should,</p>
<p>for the time being. . .</p>
<p>. . .let them unfold.</p>
<p>What--? Do nothing?</p>
<p>Offer him up as bait?</p>
<p>Potter is a boy, not a piece of meat.</p>
<p>l agree. With Severus.</p>
<p>Alastor, keep an eye on Harry, will you?</p>
<p>-l can do that.</p>
<p>-Don't let him know, though.</p>
<p>He must be anxious enough as it is. . .</p>
<p>. . .knowing what lies ahead.</p>
<p>Then again, we all are.</p>
<p>How did you do it?</p>
<p>Never mind. Doesn't matter.</p>
<p>Might've let</p>
<p>your best friend know, though.</p>
<p>-Let you know what?</p>
<p>-You know bloody well what.</p>
<p>l didn't ask for this to happen, Ron.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>-You're being stupid.</p>
<p>-Yeah, that's me.</p>
<p>Ron Weasley,</p>
<p>Harry Potter's stupid friend.</p>
<p>l didn't put my name in that cup.</p>
<p>l don't want eternal glory.</p>
<p>l just wanna be. . . .</p>
<p>Look, l don't know</p>
<p>what happened tonight. . .</p>
<p>. . .and l don't know why.</p>
<p>lt just did.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>Piss off.</p>
<p>What a charismatic quartet.</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>l'm Rita Skeeter.</p>
<p>l write for the Daily Prophet.</p>
<p>But of course you know that, don't you?</p>
<p>lt's you we don't know.</p>
<p>You're the juicy news.</p>
<p>What quirks lurk</p>
<p>beneath those rosy cheeks?</p>
<p>What mysteries do the muscles mask?</p>
<p>Does courage lie beneath those curls?</p>
<p>ln short, what makes a champion tick?</p>
<p>''Me, Myself &amp; l'' want to know.</p>
<p>Not to mention my rabid readers.</p>
<p>So who's feeling up to sharing?</p>
<p>Shall we start with the youngest?</p>
<p>Lovely.</p>
<p>This is cozy.</p>
<p>lt's a broom cupboard.</p>
<p>You should feel right at home, then.</p>
<p>Don't mind if l use</p>
<p>a Quick-Quotes Quill, do you?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>So tell me, Harry.</p>
<p>Here you sit, a mere boy of 1 2--</p>
<p>l'm 1 4. Sorry.</p>
<p>--about to compete</p>
<p>against three students. . .</p>
<p>. . .not only vastly more</p>
<p>emotionally mature than yourself. . .</p>
<p>. . .but who have mastered spells</p>
<p>that you wouldn't attempt. . .</p>
<p>. . .in your dizziest daydreams.</p>
<p>Concerned?</p>
<p>l don't know.</p>
<p>l haven't really thought about it.</p>
<p>Just ignore the quill.</p>
<p>Then, of course,</p>
<p>you're no ordinary boy of 1 2, are you?</p>
<p>-Fourteen.</p>
<p>-Your story's legend.</p>
<p>Do you think it was</p>
<p>the trauma of your past. . .</p>
<p>. . .that made you so keen to enter</p>
<p>such a dangerous tournament?</p>
<p>No, l didn't enter.</p>
<p>Of course you didn't.</p>
<p>Everyone loves a rebel, Harry.</p>
<p>Scratch that last.</p>
<p>Speaking of your parents,</p>
<p>were they alive. . .</p>
<p>. . .how do you think they'd feel?</p>
<p>Proud? Or concerned. . .</p>
<p>. . .that your attitude shows, at best,</p>
<p>a pathological need for attention. . .</p>
<p>. . .at worst, a psychotic death wish?</p>
<p>Hey, my eyes aren't</p>
<p>''glistening with the ghosts of my past. ''</p>
<p>Harry, I couldn 't risk sending Hedwig.</p>
<p>Since the World Cup, the Ministry's</p>
<p>been intercepting more and more owls...</p>
<p>...and she's too easily recognized.</p>
<p>We need to talk, Harry, face-to-face.</p>
<p>Meet me in the Gryffindor common room,</p>
<p>1:00 this Saturday night.</p>
<p>And make sure you're alone.</p>
<p>Sirius.</p>
<p>P.S.:</p>
<p>The bird bites.</p>
<p>Sirius?</p>
<p>Harry Potter, age 1 2...</p>
<p>...suspect entrant</p>
<p>in the Triwizard Tournament.</p>
<p>His eyes swimming</p>
<p>with the ghosts of his past...</p>
<p>...and choking back tears...</p>
<p>Sirius. How--?</p>
<p>l don't have much time,</p>
<p>so let me get straight to it.</p>
<p>Did you or did you not put your name</p>
<p>into the Goblet of Fire?</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>l had to ask.</p>
<p>Now, tell me about this dream of yours.</p>
<p>You mentioned Wormtail and Voldemort.</p>
<p>But who was the third man in the room?</p>
<p>-l don't know.</p>
<p>-You didn't hear a name?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Voldemort was giving him a job to do.</p>
<p>Something important.</p>
<p>And what was that?</p>
<p>He wanted. . .</p>
<p>. . .me.</p>
<p>l don't know why. But he was</p>
<p>gonna use this man to get to me.</p>
<p>But, l mean, it was only a dream, right?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>lt's just a dream.</p>
<p>Look, Harry.</p>
<p>The Death Eaters at the World Cup,</p>
<p>your name rising from that goblet. . .</p>
<p>. . .these are not just coincidences.</p>
<p>Hogwarts isn't safe anymore.</p>
<p>What are you saying?</p>
<p>l'm saying the devils are inside</p>
<p>the walls. lgor Karkaroff?</p>
<p>He was a Death Eater. And no one,</p>
<p>no one stops being a Death Eater.</p>
<p>Then there's Barty Crouch.</p>
<p>Heart of stone.</p>
<p>Sent his own son to Azkaban.</p>
<p>You think one of them</p>
<p>put my name in the goblet?</p>
<p>l haven't a clue who put your name</p>
<p>in that goblet. . .</p>
<p>. . .but whoever did is no friend to you.</p>
<p>People die in this tournament.</p>
<p>-l'm not ready for this, Sirius.</p>
<p>-You don't have a choice.</p>
<p>-Someone's coming.</p>
<p>-Keep your friends close, Harry.</p>
<p>-Who were you talking to?</p>
<p>-What?</p>
<p>-Who says l was talking to anyone?</p>
<p>-l heard voices.</p>
<p>Maybe you're imagining things.</p>
<p>Wouldn't be the first time.</p>
<p>You're probably just practicing</p>
<p>for your next interview, l expect.</p>
<p>Amazing.</p>
<p>-Amazing!</p>
<p>-Neville. You're doing it again.</p>
<p>Right, sorry.</p>
<p>''Magical Water Plants</p>
<p>of the Highland Lochs''?</p>
<p>Moody gave it to me.</p>
<p>That day we had tea.</p>
<p>lt's already been through enough people.</p>
<p>Why don't you just go</p>
<p>and talk to him yourself?</p>
<p>Ron, this is your problem, not mine.</p>
<p>What do you want me to say again?</p>
<p>Go.</p>
<p>Ronald would like me to tell you</p>
<p>that Seamus told him. . .</p>
<p>. . .that Dean was told by Parvati</p>
<p>that Hagrid's looking for you.</p>
<p>ls that right? Well, you--</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>-Are you sure you won't do this?</p>
<p>-Do it.</p>
<p>Dean was told by Parvati that. . . .</p>
<p>Please don't ask me to say it again.</p>
<p>Hagrid's looking for you.</p>
<p>-Well, you can tell Ronald--</p>
<p>-l'm not an owl!</p>
<p>Did you bring your father's cloak,</p>
<p>like l asked you?</p>
<p>Yeah, l brought the cloak.</p>
<p>Hagrid, where are we going?</p>
<p>You'll see soon enough.</p>
<p>Now pay attention, this is important.</p>
<p>What's with the flower?</p>
<p>Hagrid, have you combed your hair?</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, l have.</p>
<p>You might like to try the same thing</p>
<p>now and again.</p>
<p>Hagrid?</p>
<p>The cloak! Put the cloak on!</p>
<p>-Bonsoir, Olympe.</p>
<p>-Oh, Hagrid.</p>
<p>l thought perhaps you weren't coming.</p>
<p>l thought perhaps. . .</p>
<p>. . .you had forgotten me.</p>
<p>Couldn't forget you, Olympe.</p>
<p>What is it you wanted to show me?</p>
<p>When we spoke earlier,</p>
<p>you sounded so. . .</p>
<p>. . .exhilarated.</p>
<p>You'll be glad you came. Trust me.</p>
<p>Can we get closer?</p>
<p>Dragons?</p>
<p>That's the first task?</p>
<p>-You're joking.</p>
<p>-Come on, Harry.</p>
<p>These are seriously</p>
<p>misunderstood creatures.</p>
<p>Oh, crikey!</p>
<p>Although, l have to admit. . .</p>
<p>. . .that Horntail is a right nasty</p>
<p>piece of work.</p>
<p>Poor Ron nearly fainted</p>
<p>just seeing him, you know.</p>
<p>-Ron was here?</p>
<p>-Oh, sure.</p>
<p>His brother Charlie helped</p>
<p>to bring him over from Romania.</p>
<p>Didn't Ron tell you that?</p>
<p>No, he didn't.</p>
<p>He didn't tell me a thing.</p>
<p>-You cheat, Potter.</p>
<p>-You stink, Potter.</p>
<p>-Good luck, Potter.</p>
<p>-Potter stinks!</p>
<p>-Cedric rules.</p>
<p>-Thanks.</p>
<p>Like the badge?</p>
<p>Excuse me.</p>
<p>Harry.</p>
<p>Hey! Read the badge, Potter!</p>
<p>Can l have a word?</p>
<p>-All right.</p>
<p>-You stink, Potter!</p>
<p>-Potter, you stink!</p>
<p>-Harry Potter smells!</p>
<p>Dragons. That's the first task.</p>
<p>-They've got one for each of us.</p>
<p>-Come on, Ced!</p>
<p>Are you serious?</p>
<p>And Fleur and Krum, do they--?</p>
<p>-Yes.</p>
<p>-Come on, Ced, leave him.</p>
<p>-Right.</p>
<p>-He's not worth it.</p>
<p>-Read the badges, Potter!</p>
<p>-Hey, listen. About the badges.</p>
<p>-l've asked them not to wear them, but--</p>
<p>-Don't worry about it.</p>
<p>lt's not like l try</p>
<p>to blow things up, exactly.</p>
<p>lt just happens a fair bit.</p>
<p>You have to admit, though,</p>
<p>fire's pretty fascinating.</p>
<p>You're a right foul git, you know that?</p>
<p>-You think so?</p>
<p>-l know so.</p>
<p>Anything else?</p>
<p>-Yeah. Stay away from me.</p>
<p>-Fine.</p>
<p>-There's Potter. Cheat.</p>
<p>-Why so tense, Potter?</p>
<p>My father and l have a bet, you see.</p>
<p>l don't think you're gonna last</p>
<p>He disagrees.</p>
<p>He thinks you won't last five.</p>
<p>l don't give a damn</p>
<p>what your father thinks, Malfoy.</p>
<p>He's vile and cruel.</p>
<p>And you're just pathetic.</p>
<p>-Pathetic?</p>
<p>-Oh, no, you don't, sonny!</p>
<p>l'll teach you to curse someone</p>
<p>when their back is turned!</p>
<p>You stinking, cowardly, scummy. . .</p>
<p>-Professor Moody!</p>
<p>-. . .back-shooting--</p>
<p>-What are you doing?</p>
<p>-Teaching.</p>
<p>-ls that a--? ls that a student?</p>
<p>-Technically, it's a ferret.</p>
<p>Stand still! Stand still!</p>
<p>-My father will hear about this!</p>
<p>-ls that a threat?</p>
<p>-Professor Moody!</p>
<p>-ls that a threat?</p>
<p>Professor!</p>
<p>l could tell you stories about your father</p>
<p>that would curl even your greasy hair!</p>
<p>-Alastor! Alastor.</p>
<p>-lt doesn't end here!</p>
<p>We never use transfiguration</p>
<p>as a punishment!</p>
<p>Surely Dumbledore told you that.</p>
<p>-He might've mentioned it.</p>
<p>-Well, you will do well to remember it.</p>
<p>Away!</p>
<p>You. Come with me.</p>
<p>That's a Foe-Glass.</p>
<p>Lets me keep an eye on my enemies.</p>
<p>lf l can see the whites of their eyes,</p>
<p>they're standing right behind me.</p>
<p>Wouldn't even bother telling you</p>
<p>what's in there.</p>
<p>You wouldn't believe it if l did.</p>
<p>Now. . .</p>
<p>. . .what are you going to do</p>
<p>about your dragon?</p>
<p>Well, you know, l just thought l'd. . . .</p>
<p>Sit.</p>
<p>Listen to me, Potter.</p>
<p>Your pal Diggory?</p>
<p>By your age, he could turn a whistle into</p>
<p>a watch and have it sing you the time.</p>
<p>Miss Delacour?</p>
<p>She's as much a fairy princess as l am.</p>
<p>As for Krum, his head</p>
<p>may be filled with sawdust. . .</p>
<p>. . .but Karkaroff's is not.</p>
<p>They'll have a strategy.</p>
<p>And you can bet that it will</p>
<p>play to Krum's strengths.</p>
<p>Come on, Potter.</p>
<p>What are your strengths?</p>
<p>l don't know.</p>
<p>Well, l can fly.</p>
<p>l mean, l'm a fair flyer. But l. . . .</p>
<p>-Better than fair, the way l heard it.</p>
<p>-But l'm not allowed a broom.</p>
<p>You're allowed a wand.</p>
<p>Bets! Place your bets!</p>
<p>Bets taken! Bets taken here!</p>
<p>Step up, folks! Who fancies a flutter</p>
<p>in today's bloodbath?</p>
<p>Smart money's on Krum to survive!</p>
<p>Any bets?</p>
<p>Yes, sir?</p>
<p>Ten-to-1 for Fleur. There you go.</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
<p>Your attention, please.</p>
<p>This is a great day for all of us.</p>
<p>Each of the three tasks involves</p>
<p>very considerable danger.</p>
<p>Please keep your seats at all times.</p>
<p>This will minimize any risks</p>
<p>you may be exposed to.</p>
<p>-Harry? ls that you?</p>
<p>-Yeah.</p>
<p>I'm sure we all wish our champions...</p>
<p>-How are you feeling? Okay?</p>
<p>-... the greatest of luck.</p>
<p>The key is to concentrate.</p>
<p>After that, you just have to--</p>
<p>Battle a dragon.</p>
<p>Young love.</p>
<p>How. . .</p>
<p>. . .stirring.</p>
<p>lf everything goes unfortunately today. . .</p>
<p>. . .you two may even</p>
<p>make the front page.</p>
<p>You have no business here.</p>
<p>This tent is for champions. . .</p>
<p>. . .and friends.</p>
<p>No matter. We've got what we wanted.</p>
<p>Good day, champions.</p>
<p>Gather round, please.</p>
<p>Now, you've waited, you've wondered,</p>
<p>and at last the moment has arrived.</p>
<p>A moment only four of you</p>
<p>can fully appreciate.</p>
<p>What are you doing here, Miss Granger?</p>
<p>Sorry, l'll just go.</p>
<p>Barty, the bag.</p>
<p>Champions, in a circle around me.</p>
<p>Miss Delacour, over here. Mr. Krum.</p>
<p>And, Potter, Mr. Potter, over here.</p>
<p>That's right. Now. . .</p>
<p>. . .Miss Delacour, if you will.</p>
<p>The Welsh Green.</p>
<p>Mr. Krum.</p>
<p>The Chinese Fireball.</p>
<p>The Swedish Short-Snout.</p>
<p>-Which leaves. . . .</p>
<p>-The Horntail.</p>
<p>-What's that, boy?</p>
<p>-Nothing.</p>
<p>The Hungarian Horntail.</p>
<p>These represent four</p>
<p>very real dragons. . .</p>
<p>. . .each of which has been given</p>
<p>a golden egg to protect.</p>
<p>Your objective is simple:</p>
<p>Collect the egg.</p>
<p>This you must do,</p>
<p>for each egg contains a clue. . .</p>
<p>. . .without which you cannot hope</p>
<p>to proceed to the next task.</p>
<p>Any questions?</p>
<p>Very well. Good luck, champions.</p>
<p>Mr. Diggory, at the sound of the cannon,</p>
<p>you may--</p>
<p>Diggory! Diggory! Diggory!</p>
<p>Three of our champions</p>
<p>have now faced their dragons...</p>
<p>...and so each one of them</p>
<p>will proceed to the next task.</p>
<p>And now our fourth</p>
<p>and final contestant.</p>
<p>Harry! Harry! Harry!</p>
<p>Your wand, Harry! Your wand!</p>
<p>Accio Firebolt!</p>
<p>-Yeah!</p>
<p>-Yes!</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>-Yeah!</p>
<p>-Yeah! Well done, dragon!</p>
<p>Yes! Yes!</p>
<p>-Yes, Harry!</p>
<p>-Knew you wouldn't die. Lose a leg.</p>
<p>-Or an arm.</p>
<p>-Pack it in altogether?</p>
<p>-Never!</p>
<p>-Never!</p>
<p>Shush!</p>
<p>Go on, Harry. What's the clue?</p>
<p>-Who wants me to open it?</p>
<p>-Yes!</p>
<p>-Do you want me to open it?</p>
<p>-Yes!</p>
<p>What the bloody hell was that?</p>
<p>All right, everyone!</p>
<p>Go back to your knitting.</p>
<p>This is gonna be uncomfortable enough</p>
<p>without all you nosy sods listening in.</p>
<p>l reckon you have to be barking mad to</p>
<p>put your own name in the Goblet of Fire.</p>
<p>Caught on, have you?</p>
<p>Took you long enough.</p>
<p>l wasn't the only one</p>
<p>who thought you'd done it.</p>
<p>Everyone was saying it</p>
<p>behind your back.</p>
<p>Brilliant.</p>
<p>That makes me feel loads better.</p>
<p>-Least l warned you about the dragons.</p>
<p>-Hagrid warned me about the dragons.</p>
<p>No, no, no, l did.</p>
<p>No, don't you remember?</p>
<p>l told Hermione to tell you. . .</p>
<p>. . .that Seamus told me that Parvati</p>
<p>told Dean that Hagrid was looking for you.</p>
<p>Seamus never actually told me anything,</p>
<p>so it was really me all along.</p>
<p>l thought we'd be all right, you know. . .</p>
<p>. . .after you'd figured that out.</p>
<p>Who--? Who could possibly</p>
<p>figure that out?</p>
<p>That's completely mental.</p>
<p>Yeah. lsn't it?</p>
<p>l suppose l was a bit distraught.</p>
<p>Boys.</p>
<p>-Hi, Harry.</p>
<p>-Hi, Harry.</p>
<p>Cho, Harry's looking at you.</p>
<p>Shush.</p>
<p>Look at this!</p>
<p>l can't believe it! She's done it again.</p>
<p>''Miss Granger,</p>
<p>a plain but ambitious girl. . .</p>
<p>. . .seems to be developing a taste</p>
<p>for famous wizards.</p>
<p>Her latest prey, sources report. . .</p>
<p>. . .is none other than the</p>
<p>Bulgarian bonbon, Viktor Krum.</p>
<p>No word yet on how Harry Potter's</p>
<p>taking this latest emotional blow. ''</p>
<p>Parcel for you, Mr. Weasley.</p>
<p>Thank you, Nigel.</p>
<p>Not now, Nigel. Later.</p>
<p>Go on.</p>
<p>l told him l'd get him Harry's autograph.</p>
<p>Oh, look, Mum's sent me something.</p>
<p>Mum sent me a dress.</p>
<p>Well, it does match your eyes.</p>
<p>ls there a bonnet?</p>
<p>Nose down, Harry.</p>
<p>-Ginny, these must be for you.</p>
<p>-l'm not wearing that, it's ghastly.</p>
<p>What are you on about?</p>
<p>They're not for Ginny.</p>
<p>They're for you.</p>
<p>-Dress robes.</p>
<p>-Dress robes? For what?</p>
<p>The Yule Ball. . .</p>
<p>. . .has been a tradition</p>
<p>of the Triwizard Tournament. . .</p>
<p>. . .since its inception.</p>
<p>On Christmas Eve night,</p>
<p>we and our guests. . .</p>
<p>. . .gather in the Great Hall. . .</p>
<p>. . .for a night of well-mannered frivolity.</p>
<p>As representatives of the host school. . .</p>
<p>. . .l expect each and every one of you</p>
<p>to put your best foot forward.</p>
<p>And l mean this literally, because. . .</p>
<p>. . .the Yule Ball is, first and foremost. . .</p>
<p>. . .a dance.</p>
<p>Silence!</p>
<p>The house of Godric Gryffindor</p>
<p>has commanded the respect. . .</p>
<p>. . .of the wizard world</p>
<p>for nearly 1 0 centuries.</p>
<p>l will not have you, in the course of a</p>
<p>single evening, besmirching that name. . .</p>
<p>. . .by behaving like a babbling,</p>
<p>bumbling band of baboons.</p>
<p>Try saying that five times fast, huh?</p>
<p>Now, to dance. . . is to let the body breathe.</p>
<p>lnside every girl, a secret swan slumbers. . . longing to burst forth and take flight.</p>
<p>Something's about to burst out of Eloise Midgen, but l don't think it's a swan.</p>
<p>lnside every boy, a lordly lion prepared to prance.</p>
<p></p><p></p>
<p>Mr. Weasley.</p>
<p>Yes?</p>
<p>Will you join me, please?</p>
<p>Now, place your right hand on my waist.</p>
<p>Where?</p>
<p>My waist.</p>
<p>And extend your arm.</p>
<p>Mr. Filch, if you please.</p>
<p>One, two, three.</p>
<p>One, two, three. One, two, three.</p>
<p>Never gonna let him forget this,</p>
<p>are you?</p>
<p>-Never.</p>
<p>-Never.</p>
<p>Everybody come together.</p>
<p>Boys, on your feet!</p>
<p>Why do they have to travel in packs?</p>
<p>How are you supposed to get one</p>
<p>on their own to ask them?</p>
<p>Blimey, Harry. You've slayed dragons.</p>
<p>lf you can't get a date, who can?</p>
<p>l think l'd take the dragon right now.</p>
<p>l take after my mum.</p>
<p>Though l didn't know her very well.</p>
<p>She left when l was about 3.</p>
<p>No, not the maternal sort, her.</p>
<p>Broke me dad's heart, though.</p>
<p>He was a tiny little fella, my dad.</p>
<p>l could pick him up at the age of 6 with</p>
<p>one hand and put him up on the dresser.</p>
<p>He laughed so hard at that.</p>
<p>Very funny.</p>
<p>And then he died</p>
<p>just when l started school, so. . . .</p>
<p>So l sort of had to make</p>
<p>me own way, as it were.</p>
<p>But enough of me. What about you?</p>
<p>This is mad. At this rate, we'll be</p>
<p>the only ones in our year without dates.</p>
<p>Well, us and Neville.</p>
<p>Yeah, but, then again,</p>
<p>he can take himself.</p>
<p>lt might interest you to know</p>
<p>that Neville's already got someone.</p>
<p>Now l'm really depressed.</p>
<p>''Get a move on or all the good ones</p>
<p>will have gone. ''</p>
<p>Who you going with, then?</p>
<p>-Oi, Angelina?</p>
<p>-What?</p>
<p>Do you wanna go to the ball with me?</p>
<p>To the ball?</p>
<p>Yeah, all right.</p>
<p>Oi, Hermione.</p>
<p>You're a girl.</p>
<p>Very well spotted.</p>
<p>Come with one of us?</p>
<p>Come on. lt's one thing for a bloke</p>
<p>to show up alone.</p>
<p>For a girl, it's just sad.</p>
<p>l won't be going alone, because,</p>
<p>believe it or not, someone's asked me!</p>
<p>And l said yes!</p>
<p>Bloody hell.</p>
<p>She's lying, right?</p>
<p>lf you say so.</p>
<p>Look, we've just gotta</p>
<p>grit our teeth and do it.</p>
<p>Tonight, when we get back</p>
<p>to the common room. . .</p>
<p>. . .we'll both have partners. Agreed?</p>
<p>Agreed.</p>
<p>-Cho!</p>
<p>-Harry!</p>
<p>Watch yourself on the stairs.</p>
<p>lt's a bit icy at the top.</p>
<p>Okay, thanks.</p>
<p>Cho?</p>
<p>Yes?</p>
<p>Well, l just wondered if you--</p>
<p>l wondered if maybe</p>
<p>you wanted to go to the ball with me.</p>
<p>Sorry, l didn't catch that.</p>
<p>l was just wondering if maybe</p>
<p>you wanted to go to the ball with me.</p>
<p>Harry. . .</p>
<p>. . .l'm sorry, but someone's</p>
<p>already asked me.</p>
<p>And. . . .</p>
<p>Well, l've said l'll go with him.</p>
<p>Okay. Yeah. Great.</p>
<p>Fine. No problem.</p>
<p>Okay. Good.</p>
<p>Harry?</p>
<p>l really am. . .</p>
<p>. . .sorry.</p>
<p>lt's all right, Ron.</p>
<p>lt's okay, Ron. lt's all right.</p>
<p>lt doesn't matter.</p>
<p>What happened to you?</p>
<p>He just asked Fleur Delacour out.</p>
<p>-What?</p>
<p>-What did she say?</p>
<p>No, of course.</p>
<p>-She said yes?</p>
<p>-Don't be silly.</p>
<p>There she was, walking by.</p>
<p>You know how l like it when they walk.</p>
<p>l couldn't help it.</p>
<p>lt just sort of slipped out.</p>
<p>Actually, he sort of screamed at her.</p>
<p>lt was a bit frightening.</p>
<p>-And what did you do then?</p>
<p>-What else? l ran for it.</p>
<p>l'm not cut out for this, Harry.</p>
<p>l don't know what got into me.</p>
<p>-Hi, Harry.</p>
<p>-Hi, Harry.</p>
<p>l always liked looking at them</p>
<p>from behind.</p>
<p>She's never gonna forgive me, ever.</p>
<p>Hey!</p>
<p>Bloody hell.</p>
<p>Bloody hell.</p>
<p>Bloody. . . .</p>
<p>Oh, bloody. . . .</p>
<p>What are those? What are those?</p>
<p>-My dress robes.</p>
<p>-Well, they're all right!</p>
<p>No lace. No dodgy little collar.</p>
<p>Well, l expect yours are more traditional.</p>
<p>Traditional?! They're ancient!</p>
<p>l look like my Great Aunt Tessie!</p>
<p>l smell like my Great Aunt Tessie.</p>
<p>Murder me, Harry.</p>
<p>Leave it alone!</p>
<p>Poor kid. l bet she's alone in her room,</p>
<p>crying her eyes out.</p>
<p>-Who?</p>
<p>-Hermione, of course.</p>
<p>Come on, Harry, why do you think she</p>
<p>wouldn't tell us who she's coming with?</p>
<p>Because we'd take the mickey out of her</p>
<p>if she did.</p>
<p>Nobody asked her. Would've taken her</p>
<p>myself if she wasn't so bloody proud.</p>
<p>-Hello, boys.</p>
<p>-Hello, boys.</p>
<p>Don't you look. . .</p>
<p>. . .dashing.</p>
<p>There you are, Potter.</p>
<p>Are you and Miss Patil ready?</p>
<p>-Ready, professor?</p>
<p>-To dance.</p>
<p>lt's traditional that the three champions--</p>
<p>Well, in this case, four.</p>
<p>--are the first to dance.</p>
<p>-Surely l told you that.</p>
<p>-No.</p>
<p>Well, now you know.</p>
<p>As for you, Mr. Weasley, you may proceed</p>
<p>into the Great Hall with Miss Patil.</p>
<p>-Oh, there you are.</p>
<p>-Come on, then.</p>
<p>Come along this way.</p>
<p>Oh, come on.</p>
<p>-Hi.</p>
<p>-Now, l need you all to line up. . .</p>
<p>. . .in the procession, please.</p>
<p>Oh, you are very late.</p>
<p>This way. This way. Come along.</p>
<p>She looks beautiful!</p>
<p>Yeah, she does.</p>
<p>ls that Hermione Granger?</p>
<p>With Viktor Krum?</p>
<p>No. Absolutely not.</p>
<p>Hi!</p>
<p>Harry, take my waist.</p>
<p>-What?</p>
<p>-Now!</p>
<p>Are you ready?</p>
<p>Move your body like a hairy troll</p>
<p>Learning to rock and roll</p>
<p>Spin around like a crazy elf</p>
<p>Dancing by himself</p>
<p>Boogie down like a unicorn</p>
<p>No stopping till the break of dawn</p>
<p>Put your hands up in the air</p>
<p>Like an ogre who just don 't care</p>
<p>Can you dance like a Hippogriff?</p>
<p>Ruddy pumpkinhead, isn't he?</p>
<p>l don't think it was the books</p>
<p>that had him going to the library.</p>
<p>May l have your arm?</p>
<p>Arm. Leg. l'm yours.</p>
<p>Hot, isn't it?</p>
<p>Viktor's gone to go and get drinks.</p>
<p>Would you care to join us?</p>
<p>No, we'd not care to join you and Viktor.</p>
<p>What's got your wand in a knot?</p>
<p>He's a Durmstrang.</p>
<p>You're fraternizing with the enemy.</p>
<p>The enemy?</p>
<p>Who was it wanting his autograph?</p>
<p>Besides, the whole point</p>
<p>of the tournament. . .</p>
<p>. . .is international</p>
<p>magical cooperation. . .</p>
<p>. . .to make friends.</p>
<p>l think he's got a bit more</p>
<p>than friendship on his mind.</p>
<p>Are you going to ask me</p>
<p>to dance or not?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>-He's using you.</p>
<p>-How dare you?!</p>
<p>-Besides, l can take care of myself.</p>
<p>-l doubt it. He's way too old.</p>
<p>-What?! What? That's what you think?</p>
<p>-Yeah, that's what l think.</p>
<p>You know the solution then, don't you?</p>
<p>-Go on.</p>
<p>-Next time there's a ball. . .</p>
<p>. . .pluck up the courage and ask me</p>
<p>before somebody else does!</p>
<p>And not as a last resort.</p>
<p>Well, that's-- l mean,</p>
<p>that's just completely off the point.</p>
<p>Harry.</p>
<p>Where have you been?</p>
<p>Never mind! Off to bed, both of you.</p>
<p>-They get scary when they get older.</p>
<p>-Ron, you spoiled everything!</p>
<p>What's this about?</p>
<p>No, don 't let</p>
<p>This magic die</p>
<p>The answer's there</p>
<p>Let me see it again.</p>
<p>Yes, the time is close now.</p>
<p>Harry, at last!</p>
<p>Step aside, Wormtail,</p>
<p>so l can give our guest a proper greeting.</p>
<p>You all right, Harry?</p>
<p>l just got in.</p>
<p>Me.</p>
<p>Harry, you told me</p>
<p>you'd figured the egg out weeks ago.</p>
<p>-The task is two days from now.</p>
<p>-Really? l had no idea.</p>
<p>l suppose Viktor's</p>
<p>already figured it out.</p>
<p>Wouldn't know. We don't actually</p>
<p>talk about the tournament.</p>
<p>Actually, we don't really talk at all.</p>
<p>Viktor's more of a physical being.</p>
<p>l just mean he's not</p>
<p>particularly loquacious.</p>
<p>Mostly, he watches me study.</p>
<p>lt's a bit annoying, actually.</p>
<p>You are trying to figure this egg out,</p>
<p>aren't you?</p>
<p>What's that supposed to mean?</p>
<p>lt just means these tasks</p>
<p>are designed to test you. . .</p>
<p>. . .in the most brutal way.</p>
<p>They're almost cruel.</p>
<p>And. . .</p>
<p>. . .l'm scared for you.</p>
<p>You got by the dragons</p>
<p>mostly on nerve.</p>
<p>l'm not sure it's going</p>
<p>to be enough this time.</p>
<p>Hey, Potter!</p>
<p>-Potter!</p>
<p>-Cedric.</p>
<p>How--? How are you?</p>
<p>Spectacular.</p>
<p>l realize l never really thanked you properly</p>
<p>for tipping me off about those dragons.</p>
<p>Forget it. l'm sure you</p>
<p>would've done the same for me.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>You know the Prefects' bathroom</p>
<p>on the fifth floor?</p>
<p>lt's not a bad place for a bath.</p>
<p>Just take your egg. . .</p>
<p>. . .and mull things over</p>
<p>in the hot water.</p>
<p>l must be out of my mind.</p>
<p>l'm definitely out of my mind.</p>
<p>l'd try putting it in the water</p>
<p>if l were you.</p>
<p>Myrtle!</p>
<p>Hello, Harry.</p>
<p>Long time no see.</p>
<p>l was circling a blocked drain</p>
<p>the other day. . .</p>
<p>. . .and could swear l saw a bit</p>
<p>of Polyjuice Potion.</p>
<p>Not being a bad boy again,</p>
<p>are you, Harry?</p>
<p>Polyjuice Potion?</p>
<p>Kicked the habit. Myrtle, did you say,</p>
<p>''Try putting it in the water''?</p>
<p>That's what he did.</p>
<p>The other boy. . .</p>
<p>. . .the handsome one. . .</p>
<p>. . .Cedric.</p>
<p>Well, go on. Open it.</p>
<p>Come seek us</p>
<p>Where our voices sound</p>
<p>We cannot sing</p>
<p>Above the ground</p>
<p>An hour long you'll have to look</p>
<p>To recover what we took</p>
<p>Myrtle. . .</p>
<p>. . .there aren't merpeople</p>
<p>in the Black Lake, are there?</p>
<p>Very good.</p>
<p>lt took Cedric ages to riddle it out.</p>
<p>Almost all the bubbles were gone.</p>
<p>Harry, tell me again.</p>
<p>''Come seek us</p>
<p>where our voices sound. ''</p>
<p>The Black Lake, that's obvious.</p>
<p>''An hour long you'll have to look. ''</p>
<p>Again, obvious. Though, admittedly,</p>
<p>potentially problematic.</p>
<p>''Potentially problematic''?</p>
<p>When's the last time you held your breath</p>
<p>underwater for an hour, Hermione?</p>
<p>Look, Harry, we can do this.</p>
<p>The three of us can figure it out.</p>
<p>Hate to break up the skull session.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall</p>
<p>wants you in her office.</p>
<p>Not you, Potter,</p>
<p>just Weasley and Granger.</p>
<p>But, sir, the second task</p>
<p>is only hours away, and--</p>
<p>Exactly. Presumably Potter</p>
<p>is well prepared by now. . .</p>
<p>. . .and could do with</p>
<p>a good night's sleep.</p>
<p>Go. Now!</p>
<p>Longbottom!</p>
<p>Why don't you help Potter</p>
<p>put his books back.</p>
<p>You know,</p>
<p>if you're interested in plants. . .</p>
<p>. . .you'd be better off with</p>
<p>Goshawk's Guide to Herbology.</p>
<p>Do you know there's a wizard in Nepal</p>
<p>who's growing gravity-resistant trees?</p>
<p>Neville, no offense,</p>
<p>but l really don't care. . .</p>
<p>. . .about plants.</p>
<p>Now, if there's. . .</p>
<p>. . .a Tibetan turnip that will allow me</p>
<p>to breathe underwater for an hour. . .</p>
<p>. . .then great. But otherwise--</p>
<p>l don't know about a turnip.</p>
<p>But you could always use gillyweed.</p>
<p>-Any bets? Any bets?</p>
<p>-Come on, place your bets!</p>
<p>Step up, mates! Don't be shy.</p>
<p>-Three lads.</p>
<p>-One lady.</p>
<p>-Four go down.</p>
<p>-But do four come up?</p>
<p>Don't be so mean.</p>
<p>-Any bets?</p>
<p>-Fleur's 1 0-1 .</p>
<p>-You're sure about this, Neville?</p>
<p>-Absolutely.</p>
<p>-For an hour?</p>
<p>-Most likely.</p>
<p>Most likely?</p>
<p>Well, there is some debate</p>
<p>among herbologists. . .</p>
<p>. . .as to the effects of fresh water</p>
<p>versus salt water--</p>
<p>You're telling me this now?</p>
<p>You must be joking!</p>
<p>l just wanted to help.</p>
<p>Well, that makes you a right sight</p>
<p>better than Ron and Hermione.</p>
<p>Where are they anyway?</p>
<p>-You seem a little tense, Harry.</p>
<p>-Do l?</p>
<p>Welcome to the second task.</p>
<p>Last night, something was stolen</p>
<p>from each of our champions.</p>
<p>A treasure of sorts.</p>
<p>These four treasures,</p>
<p>one for each champion...</p>
<p>...now lie on the bottom</p>
<p>of the Black Lake.</p>
<p>In order to win...</p>
<p>...each champion need only find</p>
<p>their treasure and return to the surface.</p>
<p>-Simple enough, except for this:</p>
<p>-Put that in your mouth.</p>
<p>They will have but one hour to do so,</p>
<p>and one hour only.</p>
<p>After that, they'll be on their own.</p>
<p>No magic will save them.</p>
<p>You may begin</p>
<p>at the sound of the cannon.</p>
<p>-What's the matter with him?</p>
<p>-l don't know, l can't see him.</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>l've killed Harry Potter.</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>The Beauxbatons champion,</p>
<p>Miss Delacour...</p>
<p>...has unfortunately</p>
<p>been forced to retire...</p>
<p>...so she will take no further part</p>
<p>in this task.</p>
<p>But she's my friend too!</p>
<p>Only one!</p>
<p>Let's get down below.</p>
<p>Krum! Krum! Krum!</p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p>Ascendio!</p>
<p>Harry!</p>
<p>He's all right.</p>
<p>He's all right. Barty!</p>
<p>-Go get him another towel.</p>
<p>-l want all the judges over here now!</p>
<p>You saved her, even though</p>
<p>she wasn't yours to save.</p>
<p>My little sister.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>And you! You helped.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, a bit.</p>
<p>-Harry!</p>
<p>-Hermione!</p>
<p>Are you all right? You must be freezing.</p>
<p>Personally, l think</p>
<p>you behaved admirably.</p>
<p>l finished last, Hermione.</p>
<p>Next to last.</p>
<p>Fleur never got past the Grindylows.</p>
<p>Krum! Krum! Krum!</p>
<p>-Come on! Come on!</p>
<p>-Attention!</p>
<p>Attention!</p>
<p>The winner is Mr. Diggory. . .</p>
<p>. . .who showed innate command</p>
<p>of the Bubble-Head Charm.</p>
<p>However, seeing as Mr. Potter</p>
<p>would have finished first. . .</p>
<p>. . .had it not been for his determination</p>
<p>to rescue not only Mr. Weasley. . .</p>
<p>. . .but the others as well,</p>
<p>we've agreed to award him. . .</p>
<p>. . .second place. . .</p>
<p>-Second place!</p>
<p>-Well done!</p>
<p>. . .for outstanding moral fiber!</p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p>-Right on.</p>
<p>-All that moral fiber, eh?</p>
<p>-lt's great.</p>
<p>-Moral fiber?</p>
<p>Blimey. Even when you go wrong,</p>
<p>it turns out right.</p>
<p>-Yeah, well done, Moral Fiber.</p>
<p>-Congratulations, Potter.</p>
<p>-A fine achievement.</p>
<p>-Thank you.</p>
<p>Well done, boy.</p>
<p>-See you at Hagrid's, Harry.</p>
<p>-l'm sorry we haven't spoken.</p>
<p>After all, your story is one</p>
<p>l've heard so many times.</p>
<p>Quite remarkable, really.</p>
<p>Tragic, of course. . .</p>
<p>. . .to lose one's family.</p>
<p>Never whole again, are we?</p>
<p>Still, life goes on. . .</p>
<p>. . .and here we stand.</p>
<p>l'm sure your parents would be</p>
<p>very proud of you today, Potter.</p>
<p>Bartemius!</p>
<p>Not trying to lure Potter into one of the</p>
<p>Ministry's summer internships, are we?</p>
<p>The last boy who went into the</p>
<p>Department of Mysteries never came out!</p>
<p>And they say l'm mad.</p>
<p>Now, l remember--</p>
<p>l remember when l first met you all.</p>
<p>Biggest bunch of misfits</p>
<p>l ever set eyes on.</p>
<p>Suppose you remind me</p>
<p>of meself a little.</p>
<p>-And here we all are, four years later.</p>
<p>-We're still a bunch of misfits.</p>
<p>Well, maybe,</p>
<p>but we've all got each other.</p>
<p>And Harry, of course.</p>
<p>Soon to be the youngest</p>
<p>Triwizard champion there's ever been!</p>
<p>Hooray!</p>
<p>Hogwarts, Hogwarts</p>
<p>Hoggy Warty Hogwarts</p>
<p>Teach us something, please</p>
<p>Mr. Crouch?</p>
<p>A man has died here, Fudge. And he</p>
<p>won't be the last. You must take action.</p>
<p>l will not.</p>
<p>ln times like these, the wizard world looks</p>
<p>to its leaders for strength, Dumbledore!</p>
<p>Then for once show them some!</p>
<p>The Triwizard Tournament will not be</p>
<p>canceled. l will not be seen as a coward!</p>
<p>A true leader does what is right,</p>
<p>no matter what others think.</p>
<p>-What did you say to me?</p>
<p>-Excuse me, gentlemen.</p>
<p>lt may interest you to know</p>
<p>this conversation is no longer private.</p>
<p>Oh, Harry!</p>
<p>Harry, how good to see you again.</p>
<p>l can come back later, professor.</p>
<p>Not necessary, Harry. The minister and l</p>
<p>are done. l'll be back in a moment.</p>
<p>Minister, after you.</p>
<p>There you are. Your hat.</p>
<p>Oh, Harry, do feel free to indulge in</p>
<p>a little Licorice Snap in my absence.</p>
<p>But l have to warn you,</p>
<p>they're a wee bit sharp.</p>
<p>Professor?</p>
<p>-Professor.</p>
<p>-Yeah.</p>
<p>lgor Karkaroff, you have been brought</p>
<p>from Azkaban at your own request. . .</p>
<p>. . .to present evidence to this council.</p>
<p>Should your testimony</p>
<p>prove consequential. . .</p>
<p>. . .council may be prepared</p>
<p>to order your immediate release.</p>
<p>Until such time, you remain in the eyes</p>
<p>of the Ministry a convicted Death Eater.</p>
<p>Do you accept these terms?</p>
<p>-l do, sir.</p>
<p>-And what do you wish to present?</p>
<p>l have names, sir.</p>
<p>There was Rosier, Evan Rosier.</p>
<p>-Rosier is dead.</p>
<p>-He took a piece of me with him. . .</p>
<p>-. . .though, didn't he?</p>
<p>-l didn't know.</p>
<p>-lf that is all the witness has to offer--</p>
<p>-No, no, no.</p>
<p>There was Rookwood! He was a spy.</p>
<p>Augustus Rookwood?</p>
<p>Of the Department of Mysteries?</p>
<p>Yeah, the same.</p>
<p>He passed information to You-Know-Who</p>
<p>from inside the Ministry itself.</p>
<p>Very well. Council will deliberate.</p>
<p>ln the meantime,</p>
<p>you will return to Azkaban.</p>
<p>No! Wait, please! Please, l have more!</p>
<p>What about Snape? Severus Snape?</p>
<p>As the council is aware,</p>
<p>l've given evidence on this matter.</p>
<p>Severus Snape was indeed a Death Eater</p>
<p>and, prior to Lord Voldemort's downfall. . .</p>
<p>-. . .turned spy for us at great personal risk.</p>
<p>-lt's a lie!</p>
<p>-Today he's no more a Death Eater than l.</p>
<p>-Snape remains faithful to the Dark Lord!</p>
<p>Silence!</p>
<p>Unless the witness possesses</p>
<p>any genuine name of consequence. . .</p>
<p>. . .this session is now concluded.</p>
<p>Oh, no, no, no.</p>
<p>l've heard about one more.</p>
<p>-What's that?</p>
<p>-The name.</p>
<p>-Yes?</p>
<p>-l know for a fact. . .</p>
<p>. . .this person took part</p>
<p>in the capture. . .</p>
<p>. . .and, by means</p>
<p>of the Cruciatus Curse. . .</p>
<p>. . .torture of the Auror Frank Longbottom</p>
<p>and his wife!</p>
<p>The name.</p>
<p>Give me the wretched name!</p>
<p>Barty Crouch. . .</p>
<p>. . .Junior.</p>
<p>Hold him down!</p>
<p>Get your filthy hands off me,</p>
<p>you pathetic little men!</p>
<p>Hello, Father.</p>
<p>You are no son of mine.</p>
<p>Curiosity is not a sin, Harry.</p>
<p>But you should exercise caution.</p>
<p>lt's a Pensieve.</p>
<p>Very useful if, like me,</p>
<p>you find your mind a wee bit stretched.</p>
<p>lt allows me to see once more</p>
<p>things l've already seen.</p>
<p>You see, Harry, l have searched</p>
<p>and searched for something. . .</p>
<p>. . .some small detail. . .</p>
<p>. . .something l might have overlooked. . .</p>
<p>. . .something that would explain why</p>
<p>these terrible things have happened.</p>
<p>Every time l get close to an answer,</p>
<p>it slips away.</p>
<p>lt's maddening.</p>
<p>Sir? Mr. Crouch's son.</p>
<p>What exactly happened to him?</p>
<p>He was sent to Azkaban.</p>
<p>Destroyed Barty to do it.</p>
<p>But he had no choice.</p>
<p>The evidence was overwhelming.</p>
<p>-Why do you ask?</p>
<p>-lt's just that l. . . .</p>
<p>l had a dream about him.</p>
<p>lt was in the summer, before school.</p>
<p>In the dream, I was in a house.</p>
<p>And Voldemort was there,</p>
<p>only he wasn 't quite human.</p>
<p>And Wormtail was there too.</p>
<p>And Mr. Crouch 's son.</p>
<p>-Have there been others like this dream?</p>
<p>-Yes.</p>
<p>Always the same one.</p>
<p>Sir, these dreams. . .</p>
<p>. . .what l see, you don't think</p>
<p>it's actually happening, do you?</p>
<p>l think it's unwise for you</p>
<p>to linger over these dreams, Harry.</p>
<p>l think it's best if you simply. . .</p>
<p>. . .cast them away.</p>
<p>lt's a sign, Severus.</p>
<p>You know what it means as well as l.</p>
<p>Potter!</p>
<p>What's your hurry?</p>
<p>Congratulations, your performance</p>
<p>in the Black Lake was inspiring.</p>
<p>Gillyweed, am l correct?</p>
<p>Yes, sir.</p>
<p>lngenious.</p>
<p>A rather rare herb, gillyweed.</p>
<p>Not something found</p>
<p>in your everyday garden.</p>
<p>Nor is this.</p>
<p>Know what it is?</p>
<p>Bubble juice, sir?</p>
<p>Veritaserum.</p>
<p>Three drops of this and You-Know-Who</p>
<p>himself would spill his darkest secrets.</p>
<p>The use of it on a student is,</p>
<p>regrettably, forbidden. However. . .</p>
<p>. . .should you ever steal</p>
<p>from my personal stores again. . .</p>
<p>. . .my hand might just slip over</p>
<p>your morning pumpkin juice.</p>
<p>-l haven't stolen anything.</p>
<p>-Don't lie to me.</p>
<p>Gillyweed may be innocuous,</p>
<p>but boomslang skin, lacewing flies?</p>
<p>You and your little friends are brewing</p>
<p>Polyjuice Potion, and believe me. . .</p>
<p>. . .l'm going to find out why!</p>
<p>-Yeah!</p>
<p>-Yeah!</p>
<p>Sonorus!</p>
<p>Earlier today, Professor Moody placed</p>
<p>the Triwizard Cup deep within the maze.</p>
<p>Only he knows its exact position.</p>
<p>Now, as Mr. Diggory. . .</p>
<p>. . .and Mr. Potter. . .</p>
<p>. . .are tied for first position. . .</p>
<p>. . .they will be the first to enter the maze,</p>
<p>followed by Mr. Krum. . .</p>
<p>-. . .and Miss Delacour.</p>
<p>-Come on! Krum! Krum! Krum!</p>
<p>The first person to touch the cup</p>
<p>will be the winner!</p>
<p>l've instructed the staff</p>
<p>to patrol the perimeter.</p>
<p>Should, at any point, a contestant wish</p>
<p>to withdraw from the task. . .</p>
<p>. . .he or she need only send up</p>
<p>red sparks with their wands.</p>
<p>Contestants! Gather around. Quickly!</p>
<p>ln the maze, you'll find no dragons</p>
<p>or creatures of the deep.</p>
<p>lnstead, you'll face something</p>
<p>even more challenging.</p>
<p>You see, people change in the maze.</p>
<p>Oh, find the cup if you can.</p>
<p>But be very wary, you could just</p>
<p>lose yourselves along the way.</p>
<p>Champions, prepare yourselves!</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>
<p>-My boy.</p>
<p>-See you later, Dad.</p>
<p>On the count of three. One--</p>
<p>Fleur?</p>
<p>Fleur.</p>
<p>Periculum!</p>
<p>Get down!</p>
<p>Get down!</p>
<p>Expelliarmus!</p>
<p>No, don't! Stop!</p>
<p>He's bewitched, Cedric!</p>
<p>-Get off me!</p>
<p>-He's bewitched!</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Harry!</p>
<p>Harry!</p>
<p>Harry!</p>
<p>Harry!</p>
<p>Reducto!</p>
<p>-Thanks.</p>
<p>-No problem.</p>
<p>You know, for a moment there,</p>
<p>l thought you were gonna let it get me.</p>
<p>For a moment, so did l.</p>
<p>Some game, huh?</p>
<p>Some game.</p>
<p>Go!</p>
<p>Go on, take it.</p>
<p>You saved me, take it!</p>
<p>-Together. One, two. . .</p>
<p>-Two. . .</p>
<p>-. . .three!</p>
<p>-. . .three!</p>
<p>-You okay?</p>
<p>-Yeah. You?</p>
<p>Where are we?</p>
<p>l've been here before.</p>
<p>lt's a Portkey.</p>
<p>-Harry, the cup is a Portkey.</p>
<p>-l've been here before, in a dream.</p>
<p>Cedric! We have to get back</p>
<p>to the cup. Now!</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>-Harry! What is it?</p>
<p>-Get back to the cup!</p>
<p>-Who are you? What do you want?</p>
<p>-Kill the spare.</p>
<p>-Avada Kedavra!</p>
<p>-No! Cedric!</p>
<p>Do it! Now!</p>
<p>Bone of the father. . .</p>
<p>. . .unwillingly given.</p>
<p>Flesh of the servant. . .</p>
<p>. . .willingly sacrificed.</p>
<p>And blood of the enemy. . .</p>
<p>. . .forcibly taken.</p>
<p>The Dark Lord shall rise. . .</p>
<p>. . .again.</p>
<p>My wand, Wormtail.</p>
<p>Hold out your arm.</p>
<p>Master.</p>
<p>Thank you, master.</p>
<p>The other arm, Wormtail.</p>
<p>Welcome, my friends.</p>
<p>Thirteen years it's been, and yet. . .</p>
<p>. . .here you stand before me</p>
<p>as though it were only yesterday.</p>
<p>l confess myself. . .</p>
<p>. . .disappointed.</p>
<p>Not one of you tried to find me.</p>
<p>Crabbe! Macnair!</p>
<p>Goyle!</p>
<p>Not even you. . .</p>
<p>. . .Lucius.</p>
<p>My Lord, had l detected any sign,</p>
<p>a whisper of your whereabouts--</p>
<p>There were signs, my slippery friend.</p>
<p>And more than whispers.</p>
<p>l assure you, my Lord,</p>
<p>l have never renounced the old ways.</p>
<p>The face l have been obliged to present</p>
<p>each day since your absence. . .</p>
<p>. . .that is my true mask.</p>
<p>l returned.</p>
<p>Out of fear, not loyalty.</p>
<p>Still, you have proved yourself useful</p>
<p>these past few months, Wormtail.</p>
<p>Thank you, master.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>-Such a handsome boy.</p>
<p>-Don't touch him!</p>
<p>Harry.</p>
<p>l'd almost forgotten you were here.</p>
<p>Standing on the bones</p>
<p>of my father. Yeah.</p>
<p>l'd introduce you. . .</p>
<p>. . .but word has it you're almost</p>
<p>as famous as me these days.</p>
<p>The boy who lived.</p>
<p>How lies have fed your legend, Harry.</p>
<p>Shall l reveal what really happened</p>
<p>that night 1 3 years ago?</p>
<p>Shall l divulge how</p>
<p>l truly lost my powers?</p>
<p>Yes, shall l?</p>
<p>lt was love.</p>
<p>You see, when dear, sweet Lily Potter</p>
<p>gave her life for her only son. . .</p>
<p>. . .she provided the ultimate protection.</p>
<p>l could not touch him.</p>
<p>lt was old magic.</p>
<p>Something l should have foreseen.</p>
<p>But no matter, no matter.</p>
<p>Things have changed.</p>
<p>l can touch you. . .</p>
<p>. . .now.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Astonishing what a few drops</p>
<p>of your blood will do, eh, Harry?</p>
<p>Pick up your wand, Potter.</p>
<p>l said, pick it up! Get up! Get up!</p>
<p>You've been taught how to duel,</p>
<p>l presume, yes?</p>
<p>First, we bow to each other.</p>
<p>Come on, now, Harry.</p>
<p>The niceties must be observed.</p>
<p>Dumbledore wouldn't want you</p>
<p>to forget your manners, would he?</p>
<p>l said, bow.</p>
<p>-That's better. And now. . . .</p>
<p>-No.</p>
<p>Crucio!</p>
<p>Crucio!</p>
<p>Attaboy, Harry.</p>
<p>Your parents would be proud.</p>
<p>Especially your filthy Muggle mother.</p>
<p>Expelliar--</p>
<p>l'm going to kill you, Harry Potter.</p>
<p>l'm going to destroy you.</p>
<p>After tonight, no one will ever again</p>
<p>question my powers.</p>
<p>After tonight, if they speak of you. . .</p>
<p>. . .they'll speak only of how you. . .</p>
<p>. . .begged for death.</p>
<p>And l, being a merciful Lord. . .</p>
<p>. . .obliged.</p>
<p>Get up!</p>
<p>Don't you turn your back on me,</p>
<p>Harry Potter!</p>
<p>l want you to look at me</p>
<p>when l kill you!</p>
<p>l want to see the light</p>
<p>leave your eyes!</p>
<p>Have it your way.</p>
<p>-Expelliarmus!</p>
<p>-Avada Kedavra!</p>
<p>Do nothing! He's mine to finish!</p>
<p>He's mine!</p>
<p>Harry, when the connection is broken,</p>
<p>you must get to the Portkey.</p>
<p>We can linger for a moment</p>
<p>to give you some time. . .</p>
<p>. . .but only a moment.</p>
<p>Do you understand?</p>
<p>Harry, take my body back, will you?</p>
<p>Take my body back to my father.</p>
<p>Let go.</p>
<p>Sweetheart, you're ready.</p>
<p>Let go! Let go!</p>
<p>Accio!</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>He did it!</p>
<p>Harry!</p>
<p>Harry!</p>
<p>No! No! No, don't!</p>
<p>For God's sake, Dumbledore,</p>
<p>what's happened?</p>
<p>He's back. He's back.</p>
<p>Voldemort's back.</p>
<p>Cedric, he asked me</p>
<p>to bring his body back.</p>
<p>l couldn't leave him, not there.</p>
<p>lt's all right, Harry. lt's all right.</p>
<p>He's home. You both are.</p>
<p>Keep everybody in their seats.</p>
<p>A boy has just been killed.</p>
<p>The body must be moved, Dumbledore.</p>
<p>There are too many people.</p>
<p>Let me through.</p>
<p>Let me through!</p>
<p>Let me through!</p>
<p>That's my son!</p>
<p>That's my boy!</p>
<p>lt's my boy!</p>
<p>-Come on. Get up. Easy, easy!</p>
<p>-No.</p>
<p>This is not where you want to be</p>
<p>right now. Come on.</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>lt's all right, l got you.</p>
<p>l got you. Come on. Easy, now.</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>Are you all right, Potter?</p>
<p>Does it hurt? That?</p>
<p>Not so much now.</p>
<p>Perhaps l'd better take a look at it.</p>
<p>The cup was a Portkey.</p>
<p>Someone had bewitched it.</p>
<p>What was it like?</p>
<p>-What was he like?</p>
<p>-Who?</p>
<p>The Dark Lord.</p>
<p>What was it like</p>
<p>to stand in his presence?</p>
<p>l don't know.</p>
<p>lt was like l'd fallen</p>
<p>into one of my dreams. . .</p>
<p>. . .into one of my nightmares.</p>
<p>Were there others?</p>
<p>ln the graveyard, were there others?</p>
<p>l. . . .</p>
<p>l don't think l said anything</p>
<p>about a graveyard, professor.</p>
<p>''Marvelous creatures, dragons,</p>
<p>aren't they?''</p>
<p>Did you think that miserable oaf</p>
<p>would've led you into the woods. . .</p>
<p>. . .if l hadn't suggested it?</p>
<p>Do you think Cedric Diggory would've</p>
<p>told you to open the egg underwater. . .</p>
<p>. . .if l hadn't told him first myself?</p>
<p>Did you think Neville Longbottom,</p>
<p>the witless wonder. . .</p>
<p>. . .could've provided you with gillyweed</p>
<p>if l hadn't given him the book. . .</p>
<p>. . .that led him straight to it?</p>
<p>lt was you from the beginning.</p>
<p>You put my name in the Goblet of Fire.</p>
<p>-You bewitched Krum, but you--</p>
<p>-''But-- But--''</p>
<p>You won because l made it so, Potter.</p>
<p>You ended up in that graveyard tonight</p>
<p>because it was meant to be so.</p>
<p>And now the deed is done.</p>
<p>The blood that runs through these veins</p>
<p>runs within the Dark Lord.</p>
<p>lmagine how he will reward me</p>
<p>when he learns. . .</p>
<p>. . .that l have once and for all. . .</p>
<p>. . .silenced the great Harry Potter.</p>
<p>Expelliarmus!</p>
<p>Severus.</p>
<p>That's it, take it.</p>
<p>-Do you know who l am?</p>
<p>-Albus Dumbledore.</p>
<p>-Are you Alastor Moody? Are you?</p>
<p>-No.</p>
<p>ls he in this room? ls he in this room?</p>
<p>Harry, away from there!</p>
<p>-You all right, Alastor?</p>
<p>-l'm sorry, Albus.</p>
<p>That's Moody. But then who's--?</p>
<p>Polyjuice Potion.</p>
<p>Now we know who's been stealing</p>
<p>from your stores, Severus.</p>
<p>We'll get you up in a minute.</p>
<p>Harry!</p>
<p>Barty Crouch Junior.</p>
<p>l'll show you mine</p>
<p>if you show me yours.</p>
<p>Your arm, Harry.</p>
<p>You know what this means, don't you?</p>
<p>He's back.</p>
<p>Lord Voldemort has returned.</p>
<p>l'm sorry, sir. l couldn't help it.</p>
<p>Send an owl to Azkaban. l think</p>
<p>they'll find they're missing a prisoner.</p>
<p>-l'll be welcomed back like a hero.</p>
<p>-Perhaps.</p>
<p>Personally, l've never had much time</p>
<p>for heroes.</p>
<p>Today, we acknowledge. . .</p>
<p>. . .a really terrible loss.</p>
<p>Cedric Diggory was, as you all know. . .</p>
<p>. . .exceptionally hard-working. . .</p>
<p>. . .infinitely fair-minded. . .</p>
<p>. . .and, most importantly. . .</p>
<p>. . .a fierce, fierce friend.</p>
<p>Now, l think, therefore, you have</p>
<p>the right to know exactly how he died.</p>
<p>You see. . .</p>
<p>. . .Cedric Diggory was murdered. . .</p>
<p>. . .by Lord Voldemort!</p>
<p>The Ministry of Magic</p>
<p>does not wish me to tell you this.</p>
<p>But not to do so, l think,</p>
<p>would be an insult to his memory.</p>
<p>Now, the pain. . .</p>
<p>. . .we all feel at this dreadful loss</p>
<p>reminds me. . .</p>
<p>. . .and reminds us. . .</p>
<p>. . .that while we may come from different</p>
<p>places and speak in different tongues. . .</p>
<p>. . .our hearts beat as one.</p>
<p>ln light of recent events. . .</p>
<p>. . .the bonds of friendship we've made</p>
<p>this year will be more important than ever.</p>
<p>Remember that, and Cedric Diggory</p>
<p>will not have died in vain.</p>
<p>You remember that. . .</p>
<p>. . .and we'll celebrate a boy who was. . .</p>
<p>. . .kind and honest. . .</p>
<p>. . .and brave and true,</p>
<p>right to the very end.</p>
<p>l never liked these curtains.</p>
<p>Set them on fire in my fourth year.</p>
<p>By accident, of course.</p>
<p>l put you in terrible danger</p>
<p>this year, Harry. l'm sorry.</p>
<p>Professor. . .</p>
<p>. . .when l was in the graveyard,</p>
<p>there was a moment. . .</p>
<p>. . .when Voldemort's wand and mine</p>
<p>sort of connected.</p>
<p>Priori Incantatem.</p>
<p>You saw your parents that night,</p>
<p>didn't you?</p>
<p>They reappeared.</p>
<p>No spell can reawaken the dead, Harry.</p>
<p>l trust you know that.</p>
<p>Dark and difficult times lie ahead.</p>
<p>Soon we must all face the choice</p>
<p>between what is right and what is easy.</p>
<p>But remember this:</p>
<p>You have friends here.</p>
<p>You're not alone.</p>
<p>Hermione.</p>
<p>This is for you.</p>
<p>Write to me. Promise.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
<p>Au revoir, Ron.</p>
<p>Do you think we'll ever just have</p>
<p>a quiet year at Hogwarts?</p>
<p>-No.</p>
<p>-No.</p>
<p>No, l didn't think so. Oh, well.</p>
<p>What's life without a few dragons?</p>
<p>Everything's going to change now,</p>
<p>isn't it?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Promise you'll write this summer.</p>
<p>Both of you.</p>
<p>l won't. You know l won't.</p>
<p>-Harry will, won't you?</p>
<p>-Yeah. Every week.</p>
