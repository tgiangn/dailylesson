<h2>The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 1</h2>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: "Childhood is not from birth to a certain age. And at a certain age, the child is grown and puts away childish things. Childhood is the kingdom where nobody dies."</p>

<p><strong>[ EXT. JACOB'S HOUSE ]</strong></p>

<p><em>(O.C. Jacob storms out of his house and throws Bella and Edward's wedding invitation on the ground. He starts running off into the woods. He takes his shirt off as he is running.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Billy rolls out of the house.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Billy</strong>: Jake! Jacob!</p>
<p><em>(Jacob turns into a wolf as he heads into the forest.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Camera goes to Billy. He sighs and looks down at the wedding invitation. He picks up the wedding invitation and looks at it. Scene changes to a close up of the invitation with Charlie holding the invitation. He has his face in one hand while looking at it. Charlie looks out the window. Changes to a close up of Renee holding the wedding invitation.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Renee</strong>: Phil!</p>
<p><em>(Renee starts walking towards the house. Phil comes into the shot only seeing the back of his head.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Renee</strong>: It's happening.</p>
<p><em>(Close up of Bella walking in her wedding shoes slowly.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Camera changes to a view of Bella and Alice. Bella looks down at her feet. She stumbles a little.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Alice</strong>: You just have to break them in.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: I've been breaking them in. For three days. Can I just go barefoot?</p>
<p><strong>Alice</strong>: No, absolutely not.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Just thinking it's a little much, you know? The dress and the shoes, and all of this.</p>
<p><em>(Goes to a shot of Jasper and Carlisle carrying benches for the wedding. Then goes back to Alice.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Alice</strong>: No, it's exactly enough. Tomorrow will be perfect.</p>
<p><em>(Emmett comes in carrying a long tree trunk.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Emmett</strong>: Where do you want them, boss?</p>
<p><strong>Alice</strong>: On either side of the aisle.</p>
<p><em>(Rosalie walks past behind Emmett carrying a fat tree stump.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Rosalie</strong>: What aisle?</p>
<p><strong>Alice</strong>: Does no one have vision?</p>
<p><em>(Bella takes off her shoes and puts her converse back on. She looks up into a window in the house and looks at Edward who is watching his family get everything set up for the wedding.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Alice comes into Bella's line of vision.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Alice</strong>: You, go home and get lots of beauty sleep. That's an order.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><em>(Alice and Bella hug. Bella walks out of the shot. Alice picks up the shoes, looks at them and smiles.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Shot of Bella's house. Bella is putting something into a cardboard box. She turns around and leans slightly against the box, looking deep in thought. She walks over to her bed and looks at the dreamcatcher that Jacob gave her, that is hanging on the headboard. Edward appears behind her. She turns around and faces Edward.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: I was just checking for cold feet.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Well, mine are toasty warm.</p>
<p><em>(Bella sits down on her bed.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: It's not too late to change your mind.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: What? Now you're having second thoughts? You are.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: No, I've been waiting a century to marry you, Miss Swan.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: But?</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: I haven't told you everything about myself.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: What? You're not a virgin?</p>
<p><em>(Edward chuckles and walks around to the other side of Bella's bed. Bella turns herself to face him.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Look, you can't scare me away now.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Look, a few years after Carlisle created me, I rebelled against him. I resented him for curbing my appetite. And so for a while, I went off on my own. I wanted to know how it felt to hunt. To taste human blood.</p>

<p><strong>[ FLASHBACK ]</strong></p>

<p><em>(In a movie theater. Edward is sitting watching a movie. A lady walks past him. Edward looks at her. A man follows her and he sees that he plans on attacking the woman. Edward follows the man and the camera makes it seem like Edward wants to hunt the lady. Edward watches up with man and drinks his blood.)</em></p>

<p><strong>[ END OF FLASHBACK ]</strong></p>

<p><strong>Edward</strong>: All the men I killed were monsters. And so was I.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Edward, they were all murderers. You probably saved more lives than you took.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Bella, that's what I told myself. But they were all human beings. I looked into their eyes as they died and I saw who I was, and what I was capable of.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: And what I'll be capable of. Why are you telling me this tonight? Did you really think this was gonna change my mind about you?</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: I just wondered if it would change your mind about yourself, and who you wanna see when you look in the mirror a year from now.</p>
<p><em>(Bella gets up off the bed and goes to stand by Edward.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: I know I can do this. Let me tell you why. Because you did. You should give yourself some credit for that. Now, hopefully, a year from now, I'm gonna look in the mirror and see someone like you. I mean, someone capable of courage and sacrifice and love.</p>
<p><em>(Bella and Edward kiss. Bella hears a noise outside her window.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Emmett whistles)</em></p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: What is that?</p>
<p><strong>Emmett</strong>: Come on! Let's go!</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: I'm late for my bachelor party.</p>
<p><em>(Emmett jumps up to the window.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Emmett</strong>: Send him out, Bella, or we're coming in after him.</p>
<p><em>(Emmett jumps down from the window. Bella pulls away from Edward.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: So, this party. Will there be strippers?</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: No, just a couple of mountain lions. Maybe a few bears.</p>
<p><em>(Jasper jumps up to the window.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Jasper</strong>: Don't worry, Bella, we'll give him back in plenty of time.</p>
<p><em>(Jasper jumps down from the window and Emmett playfully shoves Jasper, and Jasper shoves back. Back to Bella and Edward.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Okay, go, before they break my house.</p>
<p><strong>Emmett</strong>: Let's go! Let's go!</p>
<p><em>(Edward walks over to the window, looks out it, then turns and faces Bella again.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: I'll meet you at the altar.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: I'll be the one in white.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: That was very convincing.</p>
<p><em>(Bella laughs. Edward jumps out the window and playfully shoves his brothers. Bella looks out the window. Emmett, Jasper, and Edward laugh and then run off. Bella looks after them, and then goes back into her room. She turns one of her lamps off and then walks over to the bed. Bella gets into her bed and turns off the lamp right beside her bed. She lies down and falls asleep.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Alice is putting on Bella's makeup.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Alice</strong>: What did I say about beauty sleep?</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Sorry, bad dream. It was wedding jitters.</p>
<p><strong>Rosalie</strong>: Do you need some help? I could do her hair.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>Rosalie</strong>: Please. I'm not offended by your choice of groom.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Just my blatant lack of respect for mortality.</p>
<p><strong>Rosalie</strong>: Essentially.</p>
<p><strong>Alice</strong>: Weddings. They bring everyone together.</p>
<p><em>(Charlie is looking at the Cullen's wall of graduation caps with curiosity.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Renee</strong>: Hey, so, did you find our daughter?</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Are those graduation caps?</p>
<p><em>(Renee turns and looks at the caps.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Renee</strong>: How creative!</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Or weird.</p>
<p><strong>Renee</strong>: Alice? Bella?</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: ln here, Mom.</p>
<p><em>(Renee sees Bella all made up.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Renee</strong>: Oh, my gosh! You're so beautiful. Oh, honey.</p>
<p><em>(She starts crying.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Renee</strong>: Crap! My mascara.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Mom!</p>
<p><em>(Alice hands Renee a handkerchief.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Renee</strong>: Thanks. Charlie, get in here.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: You sure? I don't wanna...</p>
<p><em>(Charlie walks into the room wearing his wedding tux.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: I know. I look hot.</p>
<p><em>(Laughing)</em></p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: We thought you needed something blue.</p>
<p><em>(Charlie opens the gift box containing a jeweled hair comb.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: And something old. Besides your mother.</p>
<p><strong>Renee</strong>: Nice.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: It was Grandma Swan's.</p>
<p><em>(Bella picks up the comb.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Renee</strong>: But we added the sapphires.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: It's beautiful, you guys. Wow. Thank you so much.</p>
<p><em>(Bella gives it to Alice to put in her hair.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Renee</strong>: It's your first family heirloom. Pass on to your daughter, and her daughter.</p>
<p><em>(Renee starts to cry again.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Mom, I love it.</p>
<p><em>(As she goes to kiss her parents, Alice stops her.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Alice</strong>: Nope. No smudging my masterpiece.</p>
<p><strong>Renee</strong>: She's right.</p>
<p><strong>Alice</strong>: Okay. Time for the dress! Do you wanna see it?</p>
<p><strong>Renée</strong>: I want to see it!</p>
<p><em>(Classical music playing)</em></p>
<p><em>(They are waiting for the wedding to begin.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Eric</strong>: They have got to be related.</p>
<p><strong>Mike</strong>: What a gene pool.</p>
<p><strong>Eric</strong>: Seriously. You've got some... The drool.</p>
<p><strong>Jessica</strong>: So, you think Bella's gonna be showing?</p>
<p><strong>Angela</strong>: Jess, she is not pregnant.</p>
<p><strong>Jessica</strong>: Okay. Who else gets married at 1 8?</p>
<p><em>(Bella is very nervous as they are about to walk down the aisle.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: You ready?</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Yeah. Just don't let me fall, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Never.</p>
<p><em>(They are at the altar.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Minister</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen, we are gathered here on this glorious day to witness the union of Edward Cullen and Bella Swan. Please repeat after me.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: I, Edward Cullen.</p>
<p><strong>Minister</strong>: Take you, Bella Swan.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Take you, Bella Swan.</p>
<p><strong>Minister</strong>: To have and to hold.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: To have and to hold.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: For better or for worse.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>:For richer, for poorer.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: ln sickness and in health.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: To love.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: To cherish. As long as we both shall live.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>:I do.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: I love you</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: I love you too</p>
<p><em>(They kiss and everyone stands and claps.)</em></p>
<p><em>(After at the reception, Jessica and the others are staring at the gigantic wedding cake.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Jessica</strong>: Just thought it'd be bigger.</p>
<p><strong>Eric</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><em>(Alice walks over to them.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Jessica</strong>: Hi!</p>
<p><strong>Alice</strong>: Hi, guys.</p>
<p><strong>Jessica</strong>: We were just saying how pretty everything is, you know, just saying.</p>
<p><strong>Alice</strong>: Well, thanks so much. You don't think it's too much?</p>
<p><strong>Eric</strong>: No. Not at all.</p>
<p><strong>Jessica</strong>: No. No.</p>
<p><em>(Edward and Bella are with Billy.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Nice to see you.</p>
<p><strong>Billy</strong>: I'm happy for you.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Billy</strong>: I hope you'll be happy, Bella.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Thank you, Billy. Have you heard from him?</p>
<p><strong>Billy</strong>: I'm sure Jake wishes you the best. Well, I plan on getting drunk. They're serving up some pretty fancy champagne. Sue, can I get you a glass?</p>
<p><strong>Sue</strong>: Sparkling fire water. Sounds great.</p>
<p><strong>Carmen</strong>: Bella. Congratulations, Edward.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Thank you. Bella.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Eleazar and Carmen, right?</p>
<p><strong>Carmen</strong>: Mmm-hmm. Hola.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Yes, and these are our cousins from Alaska. Tanya, Kate.</p>
<p><strong>Kate</strong>: We've heard so much about you.</p>
<p><strong>Eleazar</strong>: Welcome to the family. Bienvenida.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Thank you. Irina.</p>
<p><strong>Carmen</strong>: Come meet Bella.</p>
<p><em>(Irina is staring at Billy and Seth, she turns walks over to Carmen.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Irina</strong>: I can't do this.</p>
<p><strong>Tanya</strong>: You promised.</p>
<p><strong>Irina</strong>: They invited one.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Irina, he's our friend.</p>
<p><strong>Irina</strong>: They killed Laurent.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: He tried to kill Bella.</p>
<p><strong>Irina</strong>: I don't believe that. He wanted to be like us. To live in peace with humans. With me.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: I'm sorry.</p>
<p><em>(Irina walks away.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Carmen</strong>: Irina!</p>
<p><strong>Eleazar</strong>: Well. Let's not monopolize the bride. Congratulations.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Tanya</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><em>(They walk away.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Well, what's a wedding without some family drama?</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><em>(Emmett is getting ready to give a toast.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Emmett</strong>: Excuse me. Is this on? Hello? Umm, I'd like to propose a toast. To my new sister. Bella, I hope you've gotten enough sleep these last 18 years. 'Cause you won't be getting any more for a while.</p>
<p><em>(He laughs and everyone looks at him awkwardly.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Jessica is giving her toast.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Jessica</strong>: Well, Bella was just like everybody else, totally mesmerized by Edward. Or "The Hair," as I call him. And then, suddenly, Edward is all about Bella. Even though she's not the captain of the volleyball team.</p>
<p><em>(She laughs.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Jessica</strong>: I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding. Or the president of the student council.</p>
<p><em>(Charlie is giving his toast.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Edward will be a good husband. I know this because I'm a cop. I know things. Like how to hunt somebody to the ends of the Earth.</p>
<p><em>(Guests laughing)</em></p>
<p><em>(Alice is giving her toast.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Alice</strong>: Now that you're my sister, you'll have to get over your aversion to fashion.</p>
<p><em>(Charlie's toast)</em></p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: And I know how to use a gun.</p>
<p><em>(Alice's toast.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Alice</strong>: Skirts, heels, handbags.</p>
<p><em>(Singing)</em></p>
<p><strong>Renee</strong>: Go to sleep, my love. Go to sleep. When you wake you'll see me.</p>
<p><em>(Esme is giving her toast.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Esme</strong>: I'd like to thank Renée and Charlie for bringing such a wonderful person into the world and into our lives. We will cherish and protect her forever.</p>
<p><em>(Edward is giving his toast.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: It's an extraordinary thing to meet someone who you can bare your soul to. And who will accept you for what you are. I've been waiting, what seems like a very long time, to get beyond what I am. And with Bella, I feel like I can finally begin. So I'd like to propose a toast to my beautiful bride. No measure of time with you will be long enough. But let's start with forever.</p>
<p><em>(Edward takes Bella away from the crowd.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Seth</strong>: Whoa!</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Another one of your gifts just arrived.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Yeah, come on.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: What's a wedding present doing out here?</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Just a little more private.</p>
<p><em>(Suddenly Jacob appears ahead of them.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: The best man didn't have time to get a tux.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Jacob! Jacob.</p>
<p><em>(She runs towards him and jumps into his arms to hug him.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Both laughing)</em></p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: Hey, Bella.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: This is kind of you.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: Kind is my middle name.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: I'll see if Rosalie wants to dance.</p>
<p><em>(Edward leaves.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: I'm sorry I'm late.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Doesn't matter. Everything's perfect now.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: Will you dance with me?</p>
<p><em>(She steps closer to him and he picks her up to twirl her and then they start dancing.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Where have you been? We were gonna put your face on a milk carton.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: Mostly northern Canada. I think. It's weird to be back on two legs again, in clothes. Gotten out of practice with the whole human thing.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Are you okay? Being here?</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: Why? Afraid I'll trash your party? You're not the only one. You'd think I'd be used to telling you goodbye by now.</p>
<p><em>(Bella starts crying.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: Come on, you're not supposed to be the one crying, Bella.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Everyone cries at weddings.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: This is how I'm gonna remember you. Pink cheeks. Two left feet.</p>
<p><em>(He picks her up and twirls her and sets her down again.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: Heartbeat.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: 'Cause what, soon I'm gonna be dead to you?</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: No. I'm sorry. I'm just trying to appreciate your last night as a human.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Well, it's not my last night.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: I thought you...</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: I didn't really wanna spend my honeymoon writhing in pain.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: What's the point? It's not like you're gonna have a real honeymoon with him, anyway.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: It's gonna be as real as anyone else's.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: That's a sick joke.</p>
<p><em>(Bella gives him a look of confusion.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: You are joking?</p>
<p><em>(Bella still looks confused.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: What? While you're still human? You can't be serious, Bella. Tell me you're not that stupid.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: I mean, it's really none of your business.</p>
<p><em>(Suddenly he takes hold of her arms.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: No! You can't do this!</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Jake.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: Listen to me, Bella.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Jake, let me go!</p>
<p><em>(Suddenly Edward appears.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Jacob, calm down, all right?</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: Are you out of your mind? Huh? You'll kill her!</p>
<p><em>(As Jacob freaks out, Sam and the other werewolves come over to break up the commotion.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Sam</strong>: Walk away, Jake. Enough, Jacob!</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: Stay out of this, Sam.</p>
<p><strong>Sam</strong>: You're not gonna start something that we'll have to finish.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: She'll die.</p>
<p><strong>Sam</strong>: She's not our concern anymore. Let's go, Seth!</p>
<p><em>(Sam and the other werewolves leave and Jacob reluctantly follows them.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: I'm really, really, really stupid.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: No, it's all right. Come on, people are probably missing us. Let's go back.</p>
<p><em>(Bella and Edward are about to leave to go on their honeymoon.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Renee</strong>: So, he really won't tell you where he's taking you?</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: No, it's a surprise.</p>
<p><strong>Renee</strong>: Well, wear a hat. Sunscreen. Take care of yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: I will.</p>
<p><strong>Renee</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><em>(Renee hugs Bella.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Renee</strong>: I love you, Bella.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: I love you.</p>
<p><strong>Renee</strong>: So much.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Everything's packed and ready to go.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Cool.</p>
<p><strong>Renee</strong>: Oh. I'm gonna go see him. Yeah.</p>
<p><em>(Renee leaves.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Dad.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Well... It's gonna be strange, you not living under my roof.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Yeah. It's gonna be strange for me, too.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: You know it will always be your home, right?</p>
<p><em>(Bella nods her head.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: I love you, Dad. Forever.</p>
<p><em>(She hugs Charlie.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: I love you, too, Bells. I always have and I always will. All right. Go on. You don't wanna miss your plane. Wherever it's going.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Okay. Bye.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: You ready?</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Yeah, I'm ready.</p>
<p><em>(Quiet Road)</em></p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Please pull over.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: So, we're not staying in Rio?</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: No, we're just passing through.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Are we close?</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: That's lsle Esme. It was a gift from Carlisle.</p>
<p><em>(After they arrive on Isle Esme, Edward picks Bella up to carry her over the threshold.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: ls this totally necessary?</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: I am nothing if not traditional. You wanna take a look around? You tired? <em>(Sighing)</em></p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Do you wanna go for a swim?</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Yeah, that sounds nice. I could use a few human minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Don't take too long, Mrs. Cullen.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><em>(Bella, who's naked, joins Edward in the sea.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: You're so beautiful.</p>
<p><em>(She turns to face him and they kiss.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Don't be a coward.</p>
<p><em>(Scoffs)</em></p>
<p><em>(Romantic music playing)</em></p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: I promised we'd try. If this doesn't work...</p>
<p><em>(He shakes his head.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: I trust you. Tu vida...</p>
<p><em>(They kiss again.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Romantic music playing)</em></p>
<p><em>(Giggling)</em></p>
<p><em>(Both breathing heavily)</em></p>
<p><em>(The next morning after they've made love, Bella stands in front of a mirror remembering the previous night.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: How badly are you hurt?</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: What?</p>
<p><em>(He shows her the bruises on her arm but she turns.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: No, Bella, look.</p>
<p><em>(He pulls her robe down her shoulder and shows her the bruises on her shoulder.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Bella, I can't tell you how sorry I am.</p>
<p><em>(He turns and walks away and she follows him.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: I'm not. Really, I'm not. I'm fine.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Don't say you're fine. Just don't.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: No, you don't. Don't ruin this.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: I've already ruined it.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Why can't you see how perfectly happy I am? Or was five seconds ago. I mean, now I'm sort of pissed off, actually.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: You should be angry with me.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: I mean, we knew this was gonna be tricky, right? I think we did amazing. I mean, it was amazing for me.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: That's what you're worried about? That I didn't enjoy myself?</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: I know it's not the same for you, but for a human, I can't imagine that it gets any better than that.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Last night was the best night of my existence.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: You're the best.</p>
<p><em>(They kiss for a bit but Edward eventually pulls himself away.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: You're not gonna touch me again, are you?</p>
<p><em>(He touches her face.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: You know that's not what I mean.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Let me make you breakfast.</p>
<p><em>(He walks away from her.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Bella wakes up crying.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Bella? You having a nightmare?</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: No.</p>
<p><em>(She turns to face him.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: It was just a dream. It was a really good dream.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Then why are you crying?</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Because I wanted it to be real.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Tell me.</p>
<p><em>(She brings him towards her and kisses him.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Bella, I can't.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><em>(He gives in to her and they make love.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Emily's House)</em></p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: Maybe they'll say she was in a car crash. Or tripped and fell off a cliff.</p>
<p><strong>Paul</strong>: Keep it in play! Keep it in play! Come on! Come on! Come on!</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: At least I'll get one thing out of it.</p>
<p><strong>Sam</strong>: No, you won't. Cullens are not a danger to the town or the tribe.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: Well, he's either gonna kill her or change her. And the treaty says...</p>
<p><strong>Sam</strong>: I say, Jacob. I say.</p>
<p><strong>Embry</strong>: You know, if you wanted things different, you should've become alpha.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: Turning it down seemed like a good idea at the time.</p>
<p><strong>Set</strong>: Jake, you really think you could kill Bella if she comes back a vampire?</p>
<p><strong>Leah</strong>: No, make one of us do it, then hold a grudge against us.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: Shut up, Leah.</p>
<p><strong>Leah</strong>: Would you just get over it? It's not like you've imprinted on her.</p>
<p><em>(They look over at the werewolves who have imprinted on their soulmates.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Seth</strong>: At least they seem happy.</p>
<p><strong>Embry</strong>: Yeah, some people are just lucky, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: Lucky? None of them belong to themselves anymore. And the sickest part is their genes tell them they're happy about it.</p>
<p><strong>Leah</strong>: Least if you imprinted on someone, you'd finally forget about Bella. I mean, being any kind of happy is better than being miserable about someone you can't have.</p>
<p></p><p></p>
<p><em>(Edward and Bell arrive home.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Bella, these are our housekeepers, Gustavo and Kaure.</p>
<p><em>(Speaking Portuguese)</em></p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: This is my wife Bella. Excuse me. Well, I guess we just leave them to it.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: What was that all about?</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: She's afraid for you.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Because I have you here all alone.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: You mean she knows about you?</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: She suspects. She's native Ticuna. They have legends about blood-drinking demons who prey on beautiful women.</p>
<p><em>(He kisses her and as they are kissing the housekeepers walk in on them looking shocked.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Bell has been throwing up in the bathroom.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Bella?</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Hey, don't come in here. You don't need to see this.</p>
<p><em>(He walks into the bathroom and kneels in front of her.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: "ln sickness and health," remember?</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: It must have been the chicken. Could you grab my bag?</p>
<p><em>(He gets her bag and brings it to her, she sees her box of Tampax and pauses to think.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: How many days has it been since the wedding?</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Fourteen. Why?</p>
<p><em>(Bella doesn't reply.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Will you tell me what's going on?</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: I'm late. My period, it's late.</p>
<p><em>(She walks over to the mirror and looks at her stomach.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: That's impossible.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Can this happen?</p>
<p><em>(Suddenly she feels movement in her stomach.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Whoa!</p>
<p><em>(Bella talks to Alice on the phone.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Alice</strong>: Bella? Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: I'm not 100% sure.</p>
<p><strong>Alice</strong>: Why? What's wrong? I just...</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: You just what? Alice, what did you see?</p>
<p><strong>Alice</strong>: Here's Carlisle.</p>
<p><strong>Carlisle</strong>: Bella, what's going on?</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: I don't know. I'm a little worried. Can vampires go into shock?</p>
<p><strong>Carlisle</strong>: Has Edward been harmed?</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: No. I know that it's impossible, but I think that I'm pregnant.</p>
<p><em>(Suddenly she feels another movement in her stomach.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Whoa! Carlisle, I swear, something just moved inside me.</p>
<p><em>(Edward grabs the phone from her.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: ls this even possible?</p>
<p><strong>Carlisle</strong>: I don't know.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: What's he saying?</p>
<p><strong>Carlisle</strong>: The sooner Bella's here, the sooner we can find out what it is. I need you to get to the mainland at once.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Yeah, yeah, I will.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Well? Damn it.</p>
<p><em>(After Bella's found out she's pregnant, the housekeeper comes in to make sure Edward hasn't hurt her.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Kaure's making sure you're still alive.</p>
<p><strong>Kaure</strong>: What did you do with her?</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: What do you know about this?</p>
<p><strong>Kaure</strong>: I know that you are a demon! You killed this little girl!</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Her people have legends. She might have seen this before.</p>
<p><em>(To the housekeeper.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Please. Tell me how to help her.</p>
<p><strong>Kaure</strong>: You only do bad.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: I am begging you. I will do anything. I love her. Please. Tell me how she can survive this.</p>
<p><em>(The housekeeper walks over to Bella and touches her stomach then looks at Bella.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Kaure</strong>: Death.</p>
<p><em>(The housekeeper walks out.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: I'm not gonna let it hurt you. Carlisle will get that thing out.</p>
<p><em>(He gets their bag and walks out leaving Bella looking dismayed.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Thing?</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Wait here while we load.</p>
<p><em>(Bella calls Rosalie)</em></p>
<p><strong>Rosalie</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Rosalie.</p>
<p><strong>Rosalie</strong>: Bella? What's going on?</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: I need your help.</p>
<p><em>(Jacob's House)</em></p>
<p><strong>Billy</strong>: Hey, Son.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: What's going on?</p>
<p><em>(Referring to Charlie.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Billy</strong>: Bella called him.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Hey, haven't seen you in a while. You okay?</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: So, you finally heard from Bella?</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: They're extending their trip. Seems she caught a bug. They wanna wait until she feels better before they travel.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: She's sick?</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Yeah, she told me not to worry, but she sounded, I don't know, off.</p>
<p><strong>Billy</strong>: She'll be okay, Charlie. Come on. Let's eat. Jacob, let it go.</p>
<p><em>(Jacob goes to the Cullen's house as soon as he hears that Bella is sick.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: ls it true?</p>
<p><strong>Rosalie</strong>: Hello, Jacob, how are you?</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: Listen, just give it to me straight.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Jake, is that you?</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: She's here?</p>
<p><strong>Rosalie</strong>: They came home two weeks ago.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Jake. I'm glad you came.</p>
<p><em>(Jacob walks closer to Bella but Rosalie who is standing in front of her stops him.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Rosalie</strong>: Close enough.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: What's your problem?</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Rose, it's okay.</p>
<p><em>(He sits beside Beall who's sitting on the couch covered by a quilt.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: You look terrible.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Yeah, it's nice to see you, too.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: So, are you gonna tell me what's wrong with you?</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Rose, you wanna help me up?</p>
<p><em>(She stands up with Rosalie's help and Jacob sees she has a huge pregnant belly.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: You did this!</p>
<p><strong>Carlisle</strong>: I didn't know it was even possible.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>Carlisle</strong>: I'm not sure. Ultrasounds and needles won't penetrate the embryonic sac.</p>
<p><strong>Alice</strong>: I can't see it, either. And I can't see Bella's future anymore.</p>
<p><strong>Carlisle</strong>: We've been researching legends, but there isn't much to go on. What we do know is that it's strong. And fast-growing.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: Why haven't you done anything? Take it out of her!</p>
<p><strong>Rosalie</strong>: This is none of your business, dog.</p>
<p><strong>Esme</strong>: Rose! All this fighting isn't good for Bella.</p>
<p><strong>Alice</strong>: The fetus isn't good for Bella.</p>
<p><strong>Rosalie</strong>: Say the word, Alice. "Baby." It's just a little baby.</p>
<p><strong>Jasper</strong>: Possibly.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: Carlisle, you've gotta do something.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: No. It's not his decision. It's not any of yours.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Jacob, I need to talk to you.</p>
<p><em>(Edward walks out and Jacob follows him.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: I always knew you'd destroy her.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: She thinks Carlisle can turn her at the last minute, like he did for me and Esme.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: Can he?</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Probability is slight. And if her heart fails...</p>
<p><em>(He doesn't finish the sentence.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Look, Jacob, I need you to do something for me.</p>
<p><em>(Jacob gives a bitter laugh and turns from him.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: For her. You have a connection with her that I'll never understand. Maybe you could talk to her, change her mind. You can keep her alive.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: And if I can't?</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: If she dies, you get what you always wanted. To kill me.</p>
<p><em>(Back inside, Jacob comes in.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Rose, I'm fine, really. So, Edward sent you in here to talk to me?</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: Sort of. Though I can't figure out why he thinks you'd listen to me. I mean, you never have before.</p>
<p><em>(Both laugh)</em></p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: Since when are you and blondie BFFs?</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Rose understands what I want.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: What are you thinking, Bella? Seriously.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: I know this seems like a scary thing, but it's not. It's like this miracle or something. I can feel him.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: So, it's a bouncing baby boy. I'm sorry I didn't know. Should've brought some blue balloons.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: It's just a guess. When I picture him, I see a boy. We'll see.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: You won't.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Jake, I can do this. I'm strong enough.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: Come on. You can spout that crap to your bloodsucker, but you don't fool me. I can see what that thing's doing to you. It's a killer, Bella.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: You're wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: And when you die, what was the point? Of me loving you, you loving him. How is that right for anyone? Because I sure don't see it. Listen to me, Bella. Please. Just don't do this. Live, okay? Please.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Jake, everything's gonna be okay.</p>
<p><em>(Jacob gets up to leave.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Jacob, don't go.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: I know how this ends. And I'm not sticking around to watch.</p>
<p><em>(Jacob turns and leaves.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Jacob and the others gather in their wolf form communicating through their thoughts.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Wolves</strong>: Jake! Jake! Jake! Jake! Jake! Jake!</p>
<p><strong>Paul</strong>: Is it true, Jacob?</p>
<p><strong>Quil</strong>: What will it be?</p>
<p><strong>Paul</strong>: It's growing fast.</p>
<p><strong>Leah</strong>: It's unnatural.</p>
<p><strong>Jared</strong>: Dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>Quil</strong>: Monstrosity.</p>
<p><strong>Paul</strong>: An abomination.</p>
<p><strong>Quil</strong>: On ourland.</p>
<p><strong>Jared</strong>: We can't allow it.</p>
<p><strong>Quil</strong>: We can't allow it.</p>
<p><strong>Paul</strong>: We can't allow it.</p>
<p><strong>Wolves</strong>: We can't allow it.</p>
<p><strong>Sam</strong>: We have to protect the tribe. What they've bred won't be able to control its thirst. Every human will be in danger.</p>
<p><strong>Jared</strong>: We're ready.</p>
<p><strong>Leah</strong>: No time to waste.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: Now?</p>
<p><strong>Sam</strong>: We must destroy it before it's born.</p>
<p><strong>Seth</strong>: You mean, kill Bella?</p>
<p><strong>Sam</strong>: Her choice affects us all.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: Bella's human. Our protection applies to her.</p>
<p><strong>Leah</strong>: She's dying anyway!</p>
<p><em>(Jacob attacks Leah and they start fighting.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Sam stops Jacob and Leah from fighting.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Sam</strong>: We have real enemies to fight tonight.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: Tonight?</p>
<p><strong>Sam</strong>: You will fight with us, Jake.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: <em>(Straining)</em> I will not. I am the grandson of Ephraim Black. I am the grandson of a chief! I wasn't born to follow you, or anyone else.</p>
<p><em>(Jacob takes off.)</em></p>
<p><em>(After Jacob leaves the wolf pack now in his human form.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Seth</strong>: Don't worry. They're not following us.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: What do you think you're doing here?</p>
<p><strong>Seth</strong>: I left Sam's pack.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: Go home, Seth.</p>
<p><strong>Seth</strong>: I won't stand behind him.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: Oh, yes, you will. I'm not kidding. Get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>Seth</strong>: ls that an order? Gonna make me bow down, too?</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: I'm not ordering anyone. Look, I'm just going off on my own here, okay?</p>
<p><strong>Seth</strong>: Great, and I've got your back.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: No, you don't. If Sam comes after Bella, are you really ready to fight your own brothers? Your sister?</p>
<p><strong>Seth</strong>: If it's the right thing to do.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: Whatever. I'm gonna go give the Cullens a heads-up. Do what you want.</p>
<p><em>(Jacob turns and leaves and Seth follows him.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Seth</strong>: How cool is this? Two-man pack. Two against the world.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: You're getting on my nerves, Seth.</p>
<p><strong>Seth</strong>: I'll shut up. Can do.</p>
<p><em>(Jacob approaches Edward outside the Cullen house.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: Get ready. They're coming for Bella.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: They're not gonna touch her.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: Agreed.</p>
<p><em>(Leah and Seth approach.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Leah</strong>: Man, I can smell them from all the way out here.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: What the hell are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>Leah</strong>: I'm not gonna let my little brother get himself killed.</p>
<p><strong>Seth</strong>: Go away, Leah! I can take care of myself.</p>
<p><strong>Leah</strong>: That you think so proves you need a babysitter.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: Okay, would the both of you shut up? Did Sam send you?</p>
<p><strong>Leah</strong>: Sam doesn't even know I left.</p>
<p><em>(Wolves howling)</em></p>
<p><strong>Seth</strong>: I think he just figured it out.</p>
<p><strong>Leah</strong>: Jake. I know what his plan is.</p>
<p><em>(Inside the Cullen house.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: Sam's lost the element of surprise, and he doesn't want to take you on outnumbered, so he's not gonna come at you head on. He's got the place surrounded and he'll wait for his opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>Emmett</strong>: We won't get through without a fight.</p>
<p><strong>Carlisle</strong>: No fights. We won't be the ones to break the treaty.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: The treaty is void, at least in Sam's mind.</p>
<p><strong>Esme</strong>: Not in ours.</p>
<p><strong>Emmett</strong>: Carlisle, no one's hunted for weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Esme</strong>: We'll make do.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: You've done us a great service, Jacob. Thank you.</p>
<p><em>(At night, standing outside the Cullen's house.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: I know they're out there somewhere, but I can't hear them anymore. It's so quiet.</p>
<p><strong>Leah</strong>: I stopped hearing them, too, the second I decided to leave. It's nice.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: You know you can't stay here.</p>
<p><strong>Leah</strong>: But I don't have any place...</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: I can't trust you with the Cullens. You hate them too much. You don't even like me. LEAH: I don't have to. I just have to follow you.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: Look, Seth doesn't want you here. Neither do I.</p>
<p><strong>Leah</strong>: Being unwanted isn't exactly a new thing for me.</p>
<p><em>(Jacob doesn't reply.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Leah</strong>: Look, I'll stay out of your way. I'll do whatever you want, except go back to Sam's pack and be the pathetic ex-girlfriend he can't get away from. You don't know how many times I wished I could imprint on someone. Anyone.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: Just to break the connection.</p>
<p><em>(She nods her head in agreement.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: All right. I'm gonna do a perimeter run.</p>
<p><em>(Looking at X-rays of the fetus in Bella.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Carlisle</strong>: Your rib is cracked. But there are no splinters. You haven't punctured anything.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Yet.</p>
<p><strong>Carlisle</strong>: Edward.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: It's breaking her bones now. It's crushing you from the inside out. Carlisle, tell her what you told me. Tell her.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Carlisle, tell me. It's all right.</p>
<p><strong>Carlisle</strong>: The fetus isn't compatible with your body. It's too strong. It won't allow you to get the nutrition you need. It's starving you by the hour. I can't stop it, and I can't slow it down. At this rate, your heart will give out before you can deliver.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Then I'll hold on as long as I can, and then...</p>
<p><strong>Carlisle</strong>: Bella. There are some conditions that even venom can't overcome. You understand? I'm sorry.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Edward, I'm sorry.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: I can't live without you.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: You won't. You're gonna have a part of me. He'll need you.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Do you honestly think that I could love it or even tolerate it if it killed you?</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: It's not his fault. You have to accept what is.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Because you've given me no choice! Bella, we're supposed to be partners, remember? But you decided this on your own. You've decided to leave me.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Don't see it that way.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Well, I have no other way to see it. 'Cause it's me who'll lose you. And I don't choose that. I don't choose that.</p>
<p><em>(He turns an leaves.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Are you cold?</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: I got it.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Don't do that.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Smile like I'm your favorite person in the world.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: You're one of them.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Feels complete when you're here, Jake.</p>
<p><em>(Bella looks like she's about to be sick again.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Esme</strong>: We need to find a way to get some food into her system.</p>
<p><strong>Alice</strong>: If I could only see the fetus...</p>
<p><strong>Rosalie</strong>: The baby. ...</p>
<p><strong>Alice</strong>: Maybe I could figure out what it wants.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Think you might be right. Jacob just had an idea.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: It wasn't an idea. It was a snide comment.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: What were you thinking?</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: That it's probably just looking for someone to sink its teeth into.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: He's thirsty.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: I know the feeling. If it's craving, it's not gonna want animal blood.</p>
<p><strong>Carlisle</strong>: I have some O negative laid aside for Bella. Walk with me.</p>
<p><em>(Carlisle is pouring blood into a cup for Bella to drink.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: Wait, wait, wait. You're gonna make her drink that?</p>
<p><strong>Carlisle</strong>: It's the fastest way to test the theory.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Only if you're comfortable with it.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: I'll try anything.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Just hold on.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: I think I'm gonna be sick.</p>
<p><em>(They watch Bella drink the blood.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Tastes... good.</p>
<p><em>(Edward smiles at her and Bella drinks more of the blood.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Mmm.</p>
<p><em>(Carlisle takes her pulse.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Carlisle</strong>: Your pulse is already getting stronger.</p>
<p><strong>Esme</strong>: It's working.</p>
<p><em>(Bella is on the phone with Charlie.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Well, you sound better.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: I am. I feel much better.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: This whole thing must've put a kink in the honeymoon, huh?</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: You could say that.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Otherwise, married life treating you okay? Edward still walks on water and all that?</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Yeah, but, I mean, it is different now.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: The important thing is that you're better. And that you're coming home soon, right?</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Okay, Dad, I don't want you to freak out, but I'm going to a medical center in Switzerland.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: What? No, no, you're not. You're not going to Switzerland. What are you... You said you were better.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: I am.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: No, Bella. I'm getting on a plane. No.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: No. It's really more of a spa. And I'm sure that I'd be better by the time you got there anyway.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Bells... I don't know.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Dad, don't come. And picture me healthy, like I'm sitting on the couch with you, eating pizza or something.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: You want me to visualize?</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: They say that it helps. Just picture me like that. Like I was. It'll make me feel better. Dad, I got to go, okay?</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Bella.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: I love you.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Bella...</p>
<p><em>(Bella hangs up.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: I'm sorry I've been so angry.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: I would be, too.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: I've left you alone in this.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Marriage.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Well, they say the first year is the hardest. What was that?</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: I thought I just heard...</p>
<p><em>(He puts his hand on Bella's stomach.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Just say something else.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><em>(Edward smiles.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Edward, what's going on?</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: He likes the sound of your voice.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: You can hear him?</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: And mine. He likes my voice as well.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: What? What do you hear?</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: It's so strange. I thought he was like me, but he's not. He's like you. Good and pure. He's happy.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Of course you are. Of course you're happy. How could you not be? I love you so much. What do you hear now?</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: He loves you, Bella.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Oh, my gosh.</p>
<p><em>(Bella starts to cry with happiness as Edward kisses her stomach.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Referring to the bags of blood for Bella.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: So, that's the last of it?</p>
<p><strong>Carlisle</strong>: Bella could deliver as early as tomorrow. If she's going to have any chance at all, she'll need more blood.</p>
<p><strong>Esme</strong>: And you need to feed. You have to be at your strongest for her. We need to go tonight.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: Carlisle, you're the enemy now. Sam won't hesitate. You will be slaughtered.</p>
<p><strong>Esme</strong>: Emmett will come with us.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: That won't be enough.</p>
<p><strong>Carlisle</strong>: We have no choice, Jacob. If there's anything we can do to save her, we have to try.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: You'd risk your lives for her?</p>
<p><strong>Esme</strong>: Of course we would. Bella's a part of our family now.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: Yeah. I can see that. This really is a family. As strong as the one I was born into. I know what I have to do.</p>
<p><strong>Seth</strong>: Jake! They're coming.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>Seth</strong>: We should phase, Jacob. We can't protect ourselves like this.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: They'll see it as a threat. I wanna talk! Be easier if I could hear you, too. <em>(Spits)</em></p>
<p><em>(Meeting Sam's pack near the Cullen's house.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Paul</strong>: This isn't your territory anymore. How's the new family working out?</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: You done?</p>
<p><strong>Quil</strong>: You coming home, Jake?</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: Not until I finish this.</p>
<p><strong>Paul</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: I want Sam to take back Leah and Seth.</p>
<p><strong>Leah</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>Seth</strong>: No way!</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: Quiet!</p>
<p><em>(Turning to Sam's pack.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: I want them safe. And I want this over. I need Sam to wait until Bella's been separated from the problem.</p>
<p><strong>Paul</strong>: You mean till she's dead.</p>
<p><strong>Embry</strong>: Ease up, Paul.</p>
<p><strong>Paul</strong>: Then what?</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: Tell Sam that when the moment comes, I'll be the one to destroy it.</p>
<p><strong>Seth</strong>: Jake!</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: I'm the only one who can. They trust me.</p>
<p><em>(After Jacob has distracted Sam and his pack so that the Cullen's can get out of their house and get more blood.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Hey. Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: Yeah, it's not like I'm the one carrying a demon.</p>
<p><strong>Rosalie</strong>: This is pretty important, Bella. Why don't you tell Jacob what you've decided?</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: What now?</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Rose is trying to talk Bella out of her baby names.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: She hates them.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: Well, then I'm on your side no matter what you picked.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: They're not that bad. If it's a boy, EJ. Edward Jacob.</p>
<p><strong>Rosalie</strong>: Okay, fine, that one's not awful. Why don't you tell him the girl's name?</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: I was playing around with our moms' names. Renée and Esme. And I was thinking... Renesmee.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: Renesmee</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Too weird?</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: Um...</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: No, that's not too weird. It's beautiful. And it's unique, which certainly fits the situation. I like Renesmee.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: He likes it.</p>
<p><em>(Bella goes to take a drink of blood but suddenly her back breaks and she falls to the floor.)</em></p>
<p><em>(After Bella's back is broken she's gone into labor.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Rosalie, pass the morphine.</p>
<p><em>(Alice is talking on the phone to Carlisle.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Alice</strong>: Carlisle said the placenta must have detached.</p>
<p><em>(Edward gives Bella the morphine shot.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Alice</strong>: He's coming as fast as he can, but...</p>
<p><strong>Rosalie</strong>: We'll have to do it.</p>
<p><em>(Rosalie takes a scalpel to cut Bella's stomach open but Edward stops her.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Rose! Let the morphine spread.</p>
<p><strong>Rosalie</strong>: There's no time. He's dying.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: Get him out now!</p>
<p><em>(Rosalie cuts her stomach.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: Look at me, Bella.</p>
<p><em>(Bella screaming)</em></p>
<p><em>(Rosalie cuts Bella's stomach as the sight of blood distracts her.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Rosalie, don't!</p>
<p><em>(Edward pushes Rosalie aside.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Alice, get her out of here!</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: <em>(Exclaims)</em> Rosalie! Ow!</p>
<p><em>(Screams)</em></p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: Save her! You've got to change her!</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: I can't, not whilst he's still in there. I got to get him out first.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: Stay, Bella. Stay focused. Keep your heart beating.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: No! He's suffocating!</p>
<p><em>(Edward rips the embryonic sac with his teeth and pulls the baby out.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Okay. Hey. Hey, hey. It's Renesmee.</p>
<p><strong>Bella</strong>: You're beautiful.</p>
<p><em>(Edward gives the baby to Bella but the baby bites her and Edward takes her back after which Bella appears to die.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: Bella? Bella? Bella!</p>
<p><em>(As Jacob tries to give Bealla CPR.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Jacob, take the baby.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: Keep that away from me!</p>
<p><em>(Rosalie walks back in the room.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Rosalie</strong>: Edward. I'll take her. I promise I'm okay. Let me.</p>
<p><em>(Edward gives the baby to Rosalie and takes out a syringe and injects Bella with it.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: What is that?</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: It's my venom.</p>
<p><em>(The venom doesn't work so Edward gives Bella CPR.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: You're okay. Come on. It's supposed to be working.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: Oh, my God.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Come on. Bella, come on.</p>
<p><em>(Bella continues to be unresponsive and looking dead.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: I won't kill you. That'd be too easy. You deserve to live with this.</p>
<p><em>(In tears Jacob leaves the room as Edward continues to give Bella CPR.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: You're not dead. You're not dead. Come on! No, it will work. It will work. Please, please, please, please. Come back to me, please, baby. Bella, Bella, please, please.</p>
<p><em>(Bella looks dead on the outside but we can see the venom is moving inside her body.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Billy</strong>: I don't care what he's done. He's still my son.</p>
<p><strong>Sam</strong>: I'm sorry, Billy. I just thought you should know.</p>
<p><em>(We see Paul whispering something to Sam.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Sam</strong>: Bella's dead. It killed her. Let's go!</p>
<p><em>(As Jacob makes eye contact with Renesmee for the first time, he imprints on her, seeing her future from child to a grown woman.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Jacob <em>(V.O.)</em></strong>: It's like gravity. Your whole center shifts. Suddenly, it's not the Earth holding you here. You would do anything, be anything she needs. A friend, a brother. A protector.</p>
<p><em>(As the wolves surround the house getting ready for a fight.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Jasper</strong>: We're outnumbered.</p>
<p><strong>Alice</strong>: By a lot.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: I won't let them hurt my family.</p>
<p><em>(Suddenly the wolves attack them and they try to fight them off.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Jacob jumps into the fray of the battle of wolves against the Cullen's.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: Stop! It's over! If you kill her, you kill me.</p>
<p><em>(One of the wolves tries to attack again but Jacob turns into a wolf and stops them, Edward realizes what's happened.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Jacob imprinted. They can't hurt her. Whoever a wolf imprints on can't be harmed. It's their most absolute law.</p>
<p><em>(Bella still appears to be dead, the Cullen's bathe and dress her in fresh clothes.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: She shouldn't be this still.</p>
<p><strong>Carlisle</strong>: It's the morphine.</p>
<p><strong>Edward</strong>: Maybe I was too late.</p>
<p><strong>Carlisle</strong>: No, Edward. Listen to her heart.</p>
<p><em>(We see Bella's hair slowly thicken, her body filling out and healing, we see flashbacks of her life all the way to her parents holding her as a child, then we see Bella's face as her eyes POP OPEN TO REVEAL VAMPIRE EYES.)</em></p>
<p><em>(A girl brings the three Volturi a message on a silver platter, Aro takes the message.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Aro</strong>: Oh, its from Carlisle. Which is spelt with and S, sweet Bianca.</p>
<p><em>(He motions for his guards who appear beside Bianca. Aro reads the message.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Aro</strong>: He's added a new member to his coven.</p>
<p><strong>Marcus</strong>: Ah.</p>
<p><strong>Caius</strong>: Increasing his power.</p>
<p><em>(Suddenly Aro's guards drag Bianca away as she screams.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Aro</strong>: First it's the spelling, then the grammar.</p>
<p><em>(He hands the message to Marcus.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Marcus</strong>: At least our dispute with the Cullens is over.</p>
<p><strong>Aro</strong>: Over?</p>
<p><strong>Marcus</strong>: Mmm.</p>
<p><strong>Aro</strong>: Goodness, no. Our dispute goes far beyond the fate of a mere human.</p>
<p><strong>Caius</strong>: And what might it be?</p>
<p><strong>Aro</strong>: Why, brother, I thought you understood. They have something I want.</p>
