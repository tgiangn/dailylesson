<h2>Harry Potter and Deathly Hallows Part One</h2>
<p>These are dark time there is no denying.</p>
<p>Our world has perhaps faced no greater threat than it does today.</p>
<p>But I say this to our citizens.</p>
<p>We, ever your servants ... Will continue to defend you liberty and repel the forces that seek to take it from you.</p>
<p>Your ministry remains strong.</p>

<p>Hermione, tea is ready, Darling</p>
<p>I'm coming, Mom!</p>
<p>C'Mon Dudley hurry up</p>
<p>I still don't understand</p>
<p>why we have to leave?.</p>
<p>Because its</p>
<p>not safe around here anymore</p>
<p>Ron?</p>
<p>evening is finished.</p>
<p>Obliviate. </p>
<p>HARRY POTTER AND</p>
<p>THE DEATHLY HALLOWS </p>
<p>Severus, I was beginning to worry</p>
<p>you'd lost your way...</p>
<p>...Come, we have saved you a seat</p>
<p>You bring news, I trust</p>
<p>It will happen next Saturday.</p>
<p>At nightfall</p>
<p>I've heard differently</p>
<p>my lord.</p>
<p>Dawlish, the auror has let slip</p>
<p>that the Potter boy will not be moved</p>
<p>until the 30th of this month.</p>
<p>The day before he turns 17</p>
<p>This is a false trail</p>
<p>The auror office no longer plays any part</p>
<p>in the protection of Harry Potter.</p>
<p>Those closest to him think</p>
<p>that we have infiltrated the Ministry.</p>
<p>Well, they got that right., didn't they ?</p>
<p>What say you , Pius?</p>
<p>One hears many things</p>
<p>my lord.</p>
<p>But whether the truth is</p>
<p>among them, is not clear.</p>
<p>Spoken like a true politican.</p>
<p>you will I think</p>
<p>prove most useful, Pius.</p>
<p>Where will he be taken the boy?</p>
<p>To a safe house.</p>
<p>Most likely the home</p>
<p>of someone in the Order.</p>
<p>I'm told its been given protection</p>
<p>of every manner possible</p>
<p>Once there it will be</p>
<p>impractical to attack him</p>
<p>My lord, I'd like to</p>
<p>volunteer myself for this task.</p>
<p>I want to kill the boy</p>
<p>Wormtail</p>
<p>Have i not spoken to you</p>
<p>about keeping our guest quiet ?</p>
<p>Yes, my lord.</p>
<p>Right away, my lord.</p>
<p>As inspiring as I find</p>
<p>your bloodlust, Bellatrix ...</p>
<p>... I must be the one</p>
<p>to kill Harry Potter.</p>
<p>But I face an</p>
<p>unfortunate complication.</p>
<p>My wand and the Potters</p>
<p>share the same core.</p>
<p>They are, someways, twins.</p>
<p>We can wound but not</p>
<p>fatally harm one another.</p>
<p>If I am to kill him ...</p>
<p>... must do it with</p>
<p>anothers wand</p>
<p>Well, surely one of you</p>
<p>would like the honor</p>
<p>What about you, Lucius?</p>
<p>My lord?</p>
<p>"My Lord"?</p>
<p>I require your wand.</p>
<p>Do I detect elm?</p>
<p>Yes, my Lord.</p>
<p>And the core?</p>
<p>Dragon heartstring my lord</p>
<p>Dragon heartstringt?</p>
<p>To those of you who do not know ...</p>
<p>...we are joined here tonight</p>
<p>by Miss Charity Burbage ...</p>
<p>... who until recently taught</p>
<p>at Hogwarts School of witchcraft and wizardry</p>
<p>Her speciality was muggle studies</p>
<p>It is Miss Burbage's belief that</p>
<p>Muggles are not so different. than us</p>
<p>She would given her way ...</p>
<p>... have us mate with them.</p>
<p>To her the mixture of magical and</p>
<p>Muggle blood is not an abomination ...</p>
<p>... but something,</p>
<p>to be encouraged.</p>
<p>Severus.</p>
<p>Severus, please.</p>
<p>We're friends.</p>
<p>Nagini.</p>
<p>Dinner.</p>
<p>Hello Harry!</p>
<p>Hi!</p>
<p>Hi!</p>
<p>You're looking fit.</p>
<p>Yeah, he is absolutely gorgeous...</p>
<p>Lets say we get undercover,</p>
<p>before someone blows you..</p>
<p>Do you?</p>
<p>Kingsley, weren't you looking</p>
<p>after the PrimeMinister?</p>
<p>You are more important.</p>
<p>Hello Harry. Bill Weasley.</p>
<p>Pleasure to meet you.</p>
<p>He wasn't always so handsome</p>
<p>Daredevil.</p>
<p>True enough</p>
<p>Happened while fighting a werewolf called Greyback</p>
<p>I Would like to return the favour one day</p>
<p>You're still beautiful to me, Billy.</p>
<p>Just remember, Fleur</p>
<p>Bill takes his steak on the raw side now</p>
<p>My husband the joker.</p>
<p>By the way,</p>
<p>Wait till you hear the news...</p>
<p>Can't wait no time for cozy catch up.</p>
<p>We have to get the hell out of here.</p>
<p>Potter, you are underage, which means</p>
<p>you've still got the trace on you.</p>
<p>What is the trace?</p>
<p>If you sneezed, the Ministry</p>
<p>will know who wiped your nose.</p>
<p>The point is that we have to use those modes,</p>
<p>of transport which the trace can't detect</p>
<p>Brooms, thestrals and like</p>
<p>We'll go in pairs.</p>
<p>That way if anything is out there waiting</p>
<p>for us...I reckon there will be</p>
<p>... they won't know which</p>
<p>Harry Potter is the real one.</p>
<p>The real one ?</p>
<p>I do believe you are fully</p>
<p>aware of this particular brew</p>
<p>No, absolutely not.</p>
<p>I told you he won't take it well.</p>
<p>No, if you think that I'll let,</p>
<p>everyone risk their lives for me ...</p>
<p>Have done if before, haven't we.</p>
<p>No, no, this is different.</p>
<p>Taking that becoming me.</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>Well none of us really</p>
<p>fancy it mate</p>
<p>Yes, imagine if something went wrong,</p>
<p>and we be stuck as scrawny specky gits forever</p>
<p>Everyone here is of age, Potter.</p>
<p>They all agreed to take the risk.</p>
<p>Technically I'd been coerced</p>
<p>Mundungus Fletcher, Mr. Potter. Aways been a huge admirer.</p>
<p>Nip it, Mundungus.</p>
<p>Alright Granger its discussed</p>
<p>Blimey, Hermione!</p>
<p>Put it in there, please.</p>
<p>For those of you who haven't taken</p>
<p>polyjuice potion before, fair warning.</p>
<p>Tastes like goblin piss</p>
<p>Have enough of that</p>
<p>experience do you Mad-eye?</p>
<p>Just trying to defuse the</p>
<p>tension.</p>
<p>Wow! we are identical!</p>
<p>Not yet you are not.</p>
<p>Haven't you got something a bit more sporting?</p>
<p>Yeah I don't really fancy this color.</p>
<p>Well fancy this , you are not you</p>
<p>so shove it up and strip</p>
<p>Alright, Alright</p>
<p>You too, Potter.</p>
<p>Bill, look away, I'm hideous.</p>
<p>Ginny did lie about that tattoo.</p>
<p>Harry, your eyesight really is aweful.</p>
<p>Well,we will be pairing off.</p>
<p>Everyone will have a protector.</p>
<p>Mundungus, stick tight to me.</p>
<p>I want to keep an eye on you</p>
<p>As for Harry ...</p>
<p>Yes?</p>
<p>The real Harry.</p>
<p>Where the devil are you anyway?</p>
<p>Here.</p>
<p>You ride with Hagrid.</p>
<p>I brough you here 16 years ago,</p>
<p>when you were no bigger than a bowtruckle.</p>
<p>Seems only right that</p>
<p>I should be the one that takes you away.</p>
<p>Yes this is all very touching.</p>
<p>Lets go !</p>
<p>Head for the Burrow.</p>
<p>We rendezvous you there.</p>
<p>On the count of three!</p>
<p>Hold tight, Harry!</p>
<p>One!</p>
<p>Two!</p>
<p>Three!</p>
<p>Help!</p>
<p>Hagrid, we have to help the others!</p>
<p>We can't do that, Harry</p>
<p>Mad-Eye's orders.</p>
<p>Hang on!</p>
<p>Stupefy! </p>
<p>Hang on, Harry!</p>
<p>Hagrid!</p>
<p>No! No!</p>
<p>Harry!</p>
<p>Hagrid! Hagrid!</p>
<p>What happened?</p>
<p>Where are the others?</p>
<p>Is noone else back?</p>
<p>They were on to us</p>
<p>way from the start, Molly.</p>
<p>We didn't stand a chance.</p>
<p>Well, thank goodness</p>
<p>you two are allright</p>
<p>Death Eaters were waiting </p>
<p>for us. Attacked us.</p>
<p>George and Ron</p>
<p>should have been back.</p>
<p>A dad with Fred too.</p>
<p>Here.</p>
<p>Quick.</p>
<p>Into the house.</p>
<p>Oh My boy ...</p>
<p>Come here!</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>What creature sat in the corner the first time when </p>
<p>Harry Potter visited of my office in Hogwarts.</p>
<p>Are you mad?</p>
<p>What creature?</p>
<p>A Grindylow.</p>
<p>We have been betrayed .</p>
<p>Voldemort knew</p>
<p>you were being moved tonight.</p>
<p>I had to make sure,</p>
<p>you were not an imposter.</p>
<p>Wait!</p>
<p>The last words Albus Dumbledore,</p>
<p>spoke to the pair of us.</p>
<p>"Harry is the best hope we have."</p>
<p>"Trust him."</p>
<p>What gave you away?</p>
<p>Hedwig i think.</p>
<p>She was trying to protect me.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>He deserves that. Brilliant he was.</p>
<p>I wouldn't be standing here if it weren't for him.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Why is it always so suprising?</p>
<p>We are the last back?.</p>
<p>Where's George?</p>
<p>How are you feeling, Georgie?</p>
<p>Saintlike.</p>
<p>Come again?</p>
<p>Saintlike.</p>
<p>Im holey. I'm holey fred</p>
<p>Get it?</p>
<p>A whole wide world of ear related </p>
<p>humour and you go for holey.</p>
<p>Pathetic.</p>
<p>I'm still better looking than you.</p>
<p>Mad-Eye is dead.</p>
<p>Mundungus took one look at Voldemort</p>
<p>and disapparated.</p>
<p>head for the burrow </p>
<p>Seven. Seven.</p>
<p>This is more than I ever imagined. </p>
<p>Horcruxes ...</p>
<p>They could be hidden anywhere, couldn't they. </p>
<p>to tear the soul</p>
<p>into seven pieces ...</p>
<p>If we destroy each Horcruxes ...</p>
<p>One destroys Voldemort. </p>
<p>Harry ...</p>
<p>Trust me. </p>
<p>Do not lie to me. Do not lie to me.</p>
<p>Not </p>
<p>Going somewhere?</p>
<p>Nobody else is going to die.</p>
<p>Not for me.</p>
<p>Because of you?</p>
<p>You think Mad-Eye died</p>
<p>for you?</p>
<p>Think George</p>
<p>took that curse for you?</p>
<p>You maybe the chosen one, mate ...</p>
<p>... but this is a whole lot bigger than that.</p>
<p>Its always been bigger than that.</p>
<p>Come with me.</p>
<p>And leave Hermione?</p>
<p>Are you mad.</p>
<p>We won't last two days.</p>
<p>without her</p>
<p>Do not tell her</p>
<p>I said that.</p>
<p>Besides you still have the trace on you,</p>
<p>you still got the wedding ...</p>
<p>... the wedding ...</p>
<p>I don't care about a wedding.</p>
<p>I'm Sorry, no matter whose it is.</p>
<p>I have to start finding these Horcruxes?.</p>
<p>They are our only chance,</p>
<p>to beat him.</p>
<p>And the longer we stay here,</p>
<p>the stronger he gets.</p>
<p>Try and understand me</p>
<p>You will only be doing him a favor.</p>
<p>Do you think he knows?</p>
<p>I mean they are bits of his soul,</p>
<p>the Horcruxes.</p>
<p>Pieces of him.</p>
<p>When Dumbledore destroyed the Ring ...</p>
<p>... and you destroyed </p>
<p>Tom Riddle's Diary.</p>
<p>He must have felt something?.</p>
<p>To kill thei other Horcruxes,</p>
<p>we have to find them?.</p>
<p>Where are they?</p>
<p>Where do we start?</p>

<p>RITA SKEETER LAUNCHES NEW BOOK </p>
<p>DUMBLEDORE REMEMBERED</p>

<p>Zip me up, will you ?</p>
<p>It seems silly doesn't it </p>
<p>the wedding</p>
<p>considering whats </p>
<p>going on</p>
<p>Maybe thats the best reason to have it.</p>
<p>inspite of whats going on</p>
<p>Morning.</p>
<p>All together now!</p>
<p>One! Two! Three!</p>
<p>How it it going?</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>Well, hell.</p>
<p>What is the Minister of Magic doing here?</p>
<p>To what do we owe the pleasure, Minister?</p>
<p>I think we both know the answer</p>
<p>to that question, Mr. Potter.</p>
<p>Herein is is said forth</p>
<p>...?</p>
<p>the last will and testament of ...</p>
<p>... Albus Percival Wulfric</p>
<p>Brian Dumbledore.</p>
<p>First, to</p>
<p>Ronald Billius Weasley ... "</p>
<p>"... I leave my delumin�tor."</p>
<p>"A device, of my own making ..."</p>
<p>"... In hope when things </p>
<p>seem most dark ... "</p>
<p>"... it will show you the light."</p>
<p>Dumbledore left this for me?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Really.</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>Super.</p>
<p>" To Hermione Jean Granger ..."</p>
<p>"... I leave my copy of</p>
<p>Tales of Beedle the Bard ..."</p>
<p>"... In the hope that she finds it</p>
<p>entertaining and instructive "</p>
<p>Mom used to tell me those.</p>
<p>The wizard and the hopping pot,</p>
<p>Babbity Rabbity and the Cackling Stump ...</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>Babbity Rabbity...</p>
<p>No?</p>
<p>"To Harry James Potter ..."</p>
<p>"... I leave the snitch he caught</p>
<p>in his first match at Hogwarts... "</p>
<p>"... As a reminder of </p>
<p>rewards of perseverance ... "</p>
<p>"... And skill."</p>
<p>Is that it then?</p>
<p>Not quite.</p>
<p>Dumbledore left you ...</p>
<p>... a second bequest</p>
<p>The sword of </p>
<p>Godric Gryffindor.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the sword of Gryffindor </p>
<p>was not Dumbledore's to give away.</p>
<p>As an important</p>
<p>historical artifact it belongs ...</p>
<p>to Harry.</p>
<p>It belongs to Harry.</p>
<p>It came to him when he most </p>
<p>needed it in the Chamber of Secrets.</p>
<p>The sword may present itself to</p>
<p>any worthy Gryffindor, Miss Granger ...</p>
<p>... but that does not make it</p>
<p>that wizards property</p>
<p>Unfortunately the current</p>
<p>whereabout of the sword are unknown.</p>
<p>Excuse me?</p>
<p>The Sword is Missing.</p>
<p>I don't know what you are up,</p>
<p>to, Mr. Potter ...</p>
<p>... but you can't fight </p>
<p>this war on your own</p>
<p>He is too strong.</p>
<p>Hello, Harry.</p>
<p>i've interrupted</p>
<p>deep thoughts, haven't I?</p>
<p>I see a growing</p>
<p>in your eyes</p>
<p>Of course not.</p>
<p>How are you, Luna?</p>
<p>Very well, The garden </p>
<p>gnome has bitten my finger...</p>
<p>Gnome saliva is s very benificial.</p>
<p>Xenophilius Lovegood.</p>
<p>We live just over the hill.</p>
<p>Pleasure to meet you, sir.</p>
<p>I trust you know</p>
<p>Mr. Potter ...</p>
<p>... we at the Quibbler, disagree with Daily Prophet,</p>
<p>and have always fully supported Dumbledore ...</p>
<p>... during his lifetime and after his death,</p>
<p>and we also support you.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Come Daddy.</p>
<p>Harry does not want to talk to us right now?.</p>
<p>He is just too polite</p>
<p>to point it out.</p>
<p>Harry Potter ...</p>
<p>Excuse me, sir.</p>
<p>May I sit down?</p>
<p>Mr. Potter.</p>
<p>By all means...here</p>
<p>I found what you wrote</p>
<p>in the Daily Prophet.</p>
<p>really moving.</p>
<p>You obviously knew</p>
<p>Dumbledore well.</p>
<p>Well, I certainly</p>
<p>knew him the longest.</p>
<p>Unless we count his brother Aberforth,</p>
<p>and somehow people never do seem to count Aberforth.</p>
<p>I didn't even know</p>
<p>he had a brother.</p>
<p>Ah Well, Dumbledore was always </p>
<p>very private, even as a boy.</p>
<p>Do not despair, Elphias.</p>
<p>I'm told he has been thoroughly</p>
<p>unrevealed by Rita Skeeter.</p>
<p>in 800 pages.</p>
<p>Word has it </p>
<p>that someone talked to her.</p>
<p>Someone who knew the </p>
<p>Dumbledore family well.</p>
<p>Both you and I know</p>
<p>who that is , Elphias.</p>
<p>Monstrous betrayal.</p>
<p>Who are we talking about?</p>
<p>Bathilda Bagshot.</p>
<p>Who?</p>
<p>Oh, boy ...</p>
<p>... she's only the most celebrated</p>
<p>magical historian of the last century.</p>
<p>She was as close to Dumbledore </p>
<p>as anyone</p>
<p>Sure Rita Skeeter thought it well</p>
<p>worth a trip to Godric's Hollow ...</p>
<p>... to take a peek into</p>
<p>that old birds records.</p>
<p>Godris Hollow?</p>
<p>Bathilda Bagshot lives in Godric's Hollow?</p>
<p>Thats where she first met Dumbledore.</p>
<p>You don't say thar he lived there too.</p>
<p>His family moved </p>
<p>there ...</p>
<p>... after his father killed</p>
<p>those three Muggles.</p>
<p>It was a quite the scandal.</p>
<p>Honestly my boy ...</p>
<p>... are you sure</p>
<p>that you knew him at all?</p>
<p>Ministry has fallen. </p>
<p>Minister of Magic is dead. </p>
<p>They are coming. </p>
<p>They are coming. </p>
<p>Nice meeting you,</p>
<p>Mr. Potter.</p>
<p>Ginny!</p>
<p>Go! Go!</p>
<p>Where are we?</p>
<p>Shaftesbury Avenue.</p>
<p>I used to come up here to theaters</p>
<p>with mom and dad.</p>
<p>I do not know why I though of it. It was</p>
<p>the first thing to come to my head</p>
<p>This way.</p>
<p>Have you ever seen this before?</p>
<p>Kreacher?</p>
<p>It is Master Regulus's locket!</p>
<p>There were two, weren't there?</p>
<p>Where is the other one?</p>
<p>Kreacher deosn't know</p>
<p>about the other locket.</p>
<p>Yes, but did you ever see it?</p>
<p>It was in this house.</p>
<p>Flithy mudblood...bloodtraitor Weasley!</p>
<p>Answer her.</p>
<p>Yes It was here, in this house.</p>
<p>Most evil object.</p>
<p>What do you mean?</p>
<p>Before Master. Regulus died ...</p>
<p>... he ordered Kreacher to destroy the locket,</p>
<p>but no matter how hard Kreacher tried, </p>
<p>he could not do it.</p>
<p>Well, where is it now?</p>
<p>Did someone take it?</p>
<p>He came in the night.</p>
<p>He took many things</p>
<p>including the locket.</p>
<p>Who?</p>
<p>Who was it, Kreacher?</p>
<p>Mundungus.</p>
<p>Mundungus Fletcher.</p>
<p>Find him.</p>
<p>My father will hear about this.</p>
<p>Hey loosers.</p>
<p>He isn't here.</p>
<p>HARRY POTTER</p>
<p>UNDESIRABLE NUMBER 1 </p>
<p>As your new Minister of Magic ...</p>
<p>... I promise to restore this temple </p>
<p>of tolerance to its former glory.</p>
<p>MAGIC IS MIGHT </p>
<p>Therefore beginning today ...</p>
<p>... each employee will submit</p>
<p>themselves... to evaluation</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>But know this, that you </p>
<p>have nothing to fear...</p>
<p>... if you have nothing to hide.</p>
<p>They have flesh memories.</p>
<p>When Scrimgeour first gave it to you,</p>
<p>I thought, that it might open at to your touch.</p>
<p>Dumbledore could have</p>
<p>hidden something inside it.</p>
<p>Harry Potter!</p>
<p>Zlezte of me!</p>
<p>Expelliarmus </p>
<p>What are you playing at?</p>
<p>Setting a pair of bleeding</p>
<p>elf on me?</p>
<p>Dobby was only trying to help.</p>
<p>Dobby saw Kreacher in Diagon Alley ...</p>
<p>... which Dobby thought was curious and then</p>
<p>Dobby heard Kreacher mention Harry Potter's name.</p>
<p>And then Dobby saw Kreacher </p>
<p>talking with the thief.</p>
<p>Me a thief ?</p>
<p>You foul little ...</p>
<p>You're a thief, Dung, everyone knows it.</p>
<p>Mr. Weasley.</p>
<p>So good to see you.</p>
<p>Nice shoes.</p>
<p>Listen.</p>
<p>I panicked, alright?</p>
<p>He was right on me and</p>
<p>Mad-Eye fell off his broom</p>
<p>You ...</p>
<p>Tell the truth.</p>
<p>When you turned this place over, don't deny it</p>
<p>You found a locket am I right?</p>
<p>Boy, was it valuable?</p>
<p>Bleeding gave it away, didn't I ?</p>
<p>There I was selling my goods ...</p>
<p>... when some Ministry hag comes up</p>
<p>and asks to see my license.</p>
<p>she says </p>
<p>she would lock me up?.</p>
<p>Would have done too if she </p>
<p>didn't take a fancy to that locket.</p>
<p>Who was it?</p>
<p>The witch, do you know her?</p>
<p>No ...</p>
<p>Oh ! She's there.</p>

<p>MINISTRY SEEKS</p>
<p>EDUCATIONAL REFORM </p>
<p>Right</p>
<p>Remember what we said.</p>
<p>Don't speak to anybody,</p>
<p>Unless it is absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>Just ...</p>
<p>Try and act normal.</p>
<p>Do what everybody </p>
<p>else is doing.</p>
<p>Do that and with a bit of luck</p>
<p>we'll get inside.</p>
<p>And then ...</p>
<p>It gets really tricky.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>This is completely mental.</p>
<p>"Completely ?"</p>
<p>The world is mental.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>We have a Horcrux to find.</p>
<p>We have to flush</p>
<p>ourselves in.</p>
<p>Its bloody Disgusting.</p>
<p>Are those ...?</p>
<p>Muggles.</p>
<p>In there ... rightful place.</p>
<p>Let me tell you</p>
<p>stop to freak out a bit.</p>
<p>How long did you say</p>
<p>this polyjuice potion will last, Hermione?</p>
<p>I didn't.</p>
<p>Cattermole.</p>
<p>Its still raining inside my</p>
<p>office. Its been two days now.</p>
<p>Have you tried an umbrella?</p>
<p>You realize i'm going downstairs</p>
<p>don't you, Cattermole?</p>
<p>Downstairs?</p>
<p>To interrogate your wife.</p>
<p>Now if my wife's</p>
<p>blood status were in doubt ...</p>
<p>... and the Head of Department of Magical Law Enforcement</p>
<p>needed a job doing ...</p>
<p>... I think I might just </p>
<p>make that a priority</p>
<p>You have one hour.</p>
<p>Oh my god,</p>
<p>what am I gonna do?</p>
<p>My wife is all alone</p>
<p>downstairs.</p>
<p>Ron, you don't have a wife.</p>
<p>Oh right.</p>
<p>Level 2</p>
<p>How do I stop it raining</p>
<p>Try Finite Incantatem. </p>
<p>This is you, Ron.</p>
<p>Finite Incantatem. </p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And if it doesn't work?</p>
<p>I say if don't locate Umbridge within the hour,</p>
<p>we find Ron and come back another day.</p>

<p>Calm down. </p>
<p>Lets get back to work, please.</p>
<p>Calm down.</p>
<p>Runcorn?</p>
<p>Morning.</p>
<p>Ron, it's me.</p>
<p>Harry!</p>
<p>Blimey!</p>
<p>I forgot what you look like.</p>
<p>Where is Hermione?</p>
<p>She's gone down to the court rooms, with Umbridge.</p>
<p>I am half blood.</p>
<p>My father was a wizard.</p>
<p>He worked there 30 years.</p>
<p>Perhaps you know him.</p>
<p>He Always wore a jacket or vice versa.</p>
<p>Mary Elizabeth Cattermole,</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>It's here.</p>
<p>Mother to Maisie, Ellie and Alfred;</p>
<p>Wife to Reginald?</p>
<p>Regi.</p>
<p>Thank you, Albert.</p>
<p>Mary Elizabeth Cattermole.</p>
<p>Yes?</p>
<p>A wand was taken from you </p>
<p>upon your arrival at the Ministry Mrs Cattermole</p>
<p>Is this that wand?</p>
<p>Would you please tell the court, </p>
<p>from witch or wizard you took this wand ?</p>
<p>No one.</p>
<p>I bought it in Diagon Alley,</p>
<p>by Ollivanders, when I was 11.</p>
<p>It chose me.</p>
<p>You are lying. Wands choose only witches,</p>
<p>and you're not a witch.</p>
<p>But I am.</p>
<p>Tell them, Reg, tell them I am.</p>
<p>What on Earth are you doing, Albert?</p>
<p>You are lying, Dolores.</p>
<p>One must not tell lies.</p>
<p>Stupefy! </p>
<p>It's Harry Potter!</p>
<p>It is him. Its okay to tell the kids.</p>
<p>Expecto patronum! </p>
<p>Mary.</p>
<p>Go on home.</p>

<p>We have to leave the country, do you understand?</p>
<p>Mary, do as I say.</p>
<p>Mary?</p>
<p></p><p></p>
<p>Who is that?</p>
<p>Long story...</p>
<p>Nice meeting you.</p>
<p>Harry Potter.</p>
<p>It's Harry. Harry Potter.</p>
<p>Harry.</p>
<p>Harry, quickly, in my bag.</p>
<p>There is a bottle labeled </p>
<p>Essence of Dittany. </p>
<p>Quickly!</p>
<p>Accio Dittany! </p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>Unstopper it.</p>
<p>Hermione, his arm.</p>
<p>I know just do it!</p>
<p>Its gonna...</p>
<p>This is gonna Sting a little bit</p>
<p>What happened? I thought we</p>
<p>were going to go back to Grimmauld Place.</p>
<p>We were.</p>
<p>Alright, One more, One more</p>
<p>We were there we were there but,</p>
<p>Yaxley got a hold of me ...</p>
<p>... and he saw</p>
<p>where we went ...</p>
<p>... We couldn't stay there,</p>
<p>so I brought us here, but ...</p>
<p>... Ron splinched.</p>
<p>It's good.</p>
<p>Protego Totalum. </p>
<p>Salvia Hexi. </p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>Protective enchantments.</p>
<p>I do not want a repeat of what happened at</p>
<p>Shaftesbury Avenue, do you?</p>
<p>-Get going with a tent</p>
<p>Tent?</p>
<p>Protego Totalum. </p>
<p>Where am I supposed to find a tent?</p>
<p>Repello Mukletum.</p>
<p>Muffliato. </p>
<p>You first.</p>
<p>Incendio! </p>
<p>Incendio. </p>
<p>Expulso </p>
<p>Diffindo </p>
<p>Reducto </p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>We have to keep it safe,</p>
<p>until we find out how to destroy it.</p>
<p>Seems strange, mate.</p>
<p>Dumbledore sent you out to find those Horcruxes</p>
<p>but doesn't tell you how to destroy them</p>
<p>Doesn't it bother you?</p>
<p>You know the spell, Harry. </p>
<p>Tell me, Gregorovitch.</p>
<p>He stole it from me.</p>
<p>Who was it?</p>
<p>The thief?</p>
<p>The boy.</p>
<p>It was he who took it.</p>
<p>I never saw it again</p>
<p>I swear on my life.</p>
<p>I believe you.</p>
<p>Avada Kedavra! </p>
<p>I thought</p>
<p>it stopped.</p>
<p>You can't keep</p>
<p>, Harry.</p>
<p>You-Know- Who found Gregorovitch.</p>
<p>This Wand Maker?</p>
<p>He wants something that Gregorovitch used to have.</p>
<p>I do not know what.</p>
<p>But he wants it desperately.</p>
<p>As if his life depended on it</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Don't, its his comfort zone.</p>
<p>?</p>
<p>It sets my teeth on edge,,</p>
<p>Whats he expecting to hear? Good news?</p>
<p>One can only hope</p>
<p>not to hear bad news.</p>
<p>How long before he can travel?</p>
<p>I'm doing everyting I can.</p>
<p>-You are not doing enough?</p>
<p>Take it off!</p>
<p>I said,</p>
<p>Take it off, now!</p>
<p>Better?</p>
<p>Right .</p>
<p>We will take in turns, okay?</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>Snatchers.</p>
<p>Good to know,</p>
<p>that your enchantments work.</p>
<p>He could smell it.</p>
<p>my perfume.</p>
<p>I told you</p>
<p>Ron is not strong enough to apparate.</p>
<p>So we will go on foot then.</p>
<p>Only next time, even when I like</p>
<p>your perfume, do not use it.</p>
<p>The names of missing...</p>
<p>. </p>
<p>These are confirmed. </p>
<p>Oh, thank you.</p>
<p>He doesn't know what he is doing? does he?</p>
<p>None of us do.</p>
<p>Oh My God !</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>I'll tell you in a minute.</p>
<p>You can tell me now?</p>
<p>Sword of Gryffindor .</p>
<p>Its goblin made</p>
<p>Brilliant.</p>
<p>No, you don't understand.</p>
<p>Dirt and dust</p>
<p>have no effect on the blade.</p>
<p>It only takes in that</p>
<p>which makes it stronger.</p>
<p>Okay ...</p>
<p>we are looking for a way to destroy horcrux , right ?</p>
<p>Tom Riddle's diary in the Chamber of Secrets.</p>
<p>With a basilisk.fang</p>
<p>If you tell me you got ,</p>
<p>one of those in that bloody beeded bag of yours ...</p>
<p>Don't you see? In The Chamber of Secrets</p>
<p>you stabbed the Basilisk with the sword of Gryffindor</p>
<p>Its blade is impregnated with</p>
<p>basilisk venom.</p>
<p>It only takes in that </p>
<p>which makes it stronger</p>
<p>Exactly, which is why</p>
<p>It can destroy Horcruxes.</p>
<p>Thats why Dumbledore</p>
<p>left it to you in his will.</p>
<p>You're brilliant, Hermione.</p>
<p>Truely.</p>
<p>Actually, I just highly logical thinking,</p>
<p>which allows to me see past and irrelevant details ...</p>
<p>... and perceived cleary which</p>
<p>others overlook</p>
<p>Yeah, there is only one problem.</p>
<p>Someone stole the sword.</p>
<p>Hey, I'm still here.</p>
<p>You two carry on.</p>
<p>Don't let me spoil the fun.</p>
<p>I told you everything</p>
<p>that Dumbledore told me!</p>
<p>Incase you haven't noticed</p>
<p>We have found one Horcrux already.</p>
<p>Yes, and we are as close to getting rid </p>
<p>of it as we are to finding the rest, aren't we?</p>
<p>Ron, Please, take off the Horcrux ...</p>
<p>you wouldn't have spoken like this</p>
<p>if you hadn't wore it all day</p>
<p>You know, why I listen to the radio every night?</p>
<p>To make sure that i don't hear Ginny's name,</p>
<p>or Fred, or George or moms ...</p>
<p>You think i don't know that ?</p>
<p>You think i don't know how it feels?</p>
<p>You don't know how it feels!</p>
<p>Your parents are dead!</p>
<p>You have no family!</p>
<p>Stop! Stop!</p>
<p>Let me Go!</p>
<p>Go Then</p>
<p>Ron ...</p>
<p>And you?</p>
<p>Are you coming or </p>
<p>are you staying?</p>
<p>Fine. I get it.</p>
<p>I saw you two the other night.</p>
<p>Ron's ...</p>
<p>There is nothing.</p>
<p>Ron!</p>
<p>Ron, where are you going?</p>
<p>Come back, now!</p>
<p>Salvia Hexi</p>
<p>I opens at the close </p>
<p>Hermione?</p>
<p>Hermione?</p>
<p>You were right.</p>
<p>Snithced have flesh memory ...</p>
<p>... but I did not catch the first snitch with my hand.</p>
<p>I almost swallowed it.</p>
<p>"I open at the close."</p>
<p>What do you think that means?</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>I found something as well</p>
<p>At first I thought it was an eye</p>
<p>it's eye, but now I don't think it is.</p>
<p>And it's no rune,</p>
<p>it is anywhere in Spellmans syllabury.</p>
<p>Someone wrote it there.</p>
<p>Somebody inked it in</p>
<p>it isn't part of the book</p>
<p>Luna's dad was wearing that at</p>
<p>the wedding of Bill and Fleur.</p>
<p>Why would someone draw</p>
<p>it in a childrens book?</p>
<p>Hermione, I've been thinking</p>
<p>I want to go to Godric's Hollow</p>
<p>Its where I was born ,</p>
<p>Its where my parents died.</p>
<p>Thats exactly why they'll expect you to go</p>
<p>it means something to you</p>
<p>But it means something to</p>
<p>him too, Hermione.</p>
<p>You-Know-Who almost died there.</p>
<p>Isn't that exactly the type of place</p>
<p>he'd be likely to hide a Horcrux?</p>
<p>It is dangerous, Harry.</p>
<p>But I admit it recently I've been thinking </p>
<p>we have to go there</p>
<p>I think its is possible that </p>
<p>something else is hidden there.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>The Sword.</p>
<p>If Dumbledore wanted you to find it,</p>
<p>and to not let it fall into the hands of the Ministry ...</p>
<p>... what better place to hide it</p>
<p>than the birthplace of founder of Gryffindor</p>
<p>Hermione ...</p>
<p>Don't tell me I have to give</p>
<p>you a haircut again</p>
<p>I still think that we </p>
<p>should use Polyjuice Potion.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>This is where I was born.</p>
<p>I don't want to return?,</p>
<p>as someone else.</p>
<p>Harry, I think it is Christmas eve.</p>
<p>Listen.</p>
<p>Do you think they are here, Hermione?</p>
<p>My mom and dad.</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>Ignotus Peverell.</p>
<p>Hey, Harry?</p>
<p>Merry Christmas, Hermione.</p>
<p>Merry Christmas, Harry.</p>
<p>Harry, someone is watching us.</p>
<p>Near the church.</p>
<p>I think I know who it is.</p>
<p>I don't know this, Harry.</p>
<p>Hermione, Dumbledore knew.</p>
<p>She might have the sword.</p>
<p>This is where they died, Hermione.</p>
<p>This is where he murdered them.</p>
<p>Bathilda, aren't you ?</p>
<p>Leave it, let me do that.</p>
<p>Miss Bagshot,</p>
<p>Who is this man?</p>
<p>Harry!</p>
<p>Are you feeling better?</p>
<p>This time can be overcome,</p>
<p>Hermione.</p>
<p>Forest of Dean.</p>
<p>I came here once with my mother and father.</p>
<p>Years ago.</p>
<p>Its just</p>
<p>how I remember it.</p>
<p>Trees, the river, everything.</p>
<p>Like nothings changed.</p>
<p>This of course is true,</p>
<p>everything has changed.</p>
<p>If there were my parents,</p>
<p>they would have nothing nepam�tali.</p>
<p>Or trees.</p>
<p>Or river.</p>
<p>Not even me.</p>
<p>Perhaps we should</p>
<p>stay here, Harry.</p>
<p>Grow old?.</p>
<p>You wanted to know</p>
<p>Who was the boy in the photograph was.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>Gellert Grindelwald.</p>
<p>He's the thief I saw</p>
<p>in Gregorovitch's wandshop.</p>
<p>Speaking of which</p>
<p>where's my wand?</p>
<p>Where's my wand, Hermione?</p>
<p>As we were leaving Godrics Hollow I cast a curse.</p>
<p>and it rebounded</p>
<p>I'm sorry.</p>
<p>I tried to mend it,</p>
<p>But wands are different.</p>
<p>Its nothing.</p>
<p>Lend me yours.</p>
<p>Go inside and get warm.</p>
<p>I'll take the locket as well.</p>
<p>Lumos. </p>
<p>Accio sword! </p>
<p>Diffindo. </p>
<p>Hermione?</p>
<p>Are you mental?</p>
<p>Ron, is that you?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Didn't hurt yourself did you ?</p>
<p>You cast the doe as well did you?</p>
<p>No, I thought that was you.</p>
<p>No, my Patronus is a stag.</p>
<p>Clear.</p>
<p>Okay, Ron.</p>
<p>Do it.</p>
<p>I can not. The thing affect me more</p>
<p>as you and Hermione.</p>
<p>All the more reason</p>
<p>I can not.</p>
<p>then why are you here?</p>
<p>Why did you come back?</p>
<p>I'll have to speak to it to open it</p>
<p>When it does, don't hesitate.</p>
<p>I don't know whats in there, but it will put up a fight?.</p>
<p>The bit of Riddle in the diary was trying to kill me?.</p>
<p>One.</p>
<p>Two.</p>
<p>Three.</p>
<p>and I see your heart and it is mine. </p>
<p>I see your dreams,</p>
<p>Ronald Weasley. </p>
<p>I see your fear. </p>
<p>hated her mother,</p>
<p>who longed for a daughter. </p>
<p>Not My Favorites girl? om,</p>
<p>wishing your friend a. </p>
<p>Ron!</p>
<p>we were better without you. </p>
<p>happy without you ? astnej��. </p>
<p>Who would choose you ...</p>
<p>... compared to Harry Potter? </p>
<p>What are you compared to the chosen one? </p>
<p>Ron, its lying!</p>
<p>Your mother confessed,</p>
<p>she would prefer as a son. </p>
<p>What woman would take you? </p>
<p>you are .</p>
<p>Nothing...Nothing </p>
<p>Nothing compared to him. </p>
<p>Just think</p>
<p>There are only three to go.</p>
<p>Hermione?</p>
<p>Hermione?</p>
<p>Is everything alright?</p>
<p>Fine...</p>
<p>Actually its more than fine.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>You ...</p>
<p>... a complete arse of,</p>
<p>a Weasley!</p>
<p>You show up here after weeks</p>
<p>and you say 'hey'?</p>
<p>Where's my wand, Harry?</p>
<p>Where is my wand?</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>Harry Potter</p>
<p>You give me my wand!</p>
<p>-What happened to your wand?</p>
<p>Nevermind he's got my wand.</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>You destroyed it.</p>
<p>And how is it that you just happened to have the</p>
<p>sword of Gryffindor ?</p>
<p>It's a long story.</p>
<p>Don't think</p>
<p>it changes anything.</p>
<p>Of course not. I only destroyed a</p>
<p>bloody Horcrux, why will that change anything.</p>
<p>I wanted to come back</p>
<p>as soon as I left.</p>
<p>-just didn't know how to find you</p>
<p>how did you found us ?</p>
<p>With this. Doesn't just</p>
<p>Turn out lights</p>
<p>I don't know how it works</p>
<p>but christmas morning I sleping in this little pub ...</p>
<p>... keeping away from some snatchers.</p>
<p>When I heard it.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Voice.</p>
<p>Your voice, Hermione.</p>
<p>comin out of it.</p>
<p>And what exactly did I say</p>
<p>if I may ask?</p>
<p>My name.</p>
<p>Just my name.</p>
<p>like a Whisper</p>
<p>So I took it, clicked it ...</p>
<p>... this tiny ball of light appeared</p>
<p>And I knew.</p>
<p>sure enough.</p>
<p>Flew towards me,</p>
<p>ball of light.</p>
<p>Right into my chest.</p>
<p>Straight through me.</p>
<p>Right here</p>
<p>I knew that it was gonna take me</p>
<p>where I needed to go</p>
<p>so I disapparated</p>
<p>came to this hillside</p>
<p>It was dark, I had</p>
<p>no idea where I was.</p>
<p>I just hoped</p>
<p>One of you will show yourself</p>
<p>you did</p>
<p>I have always liked these flames</p>
<p>Hermione makes.</p>
<p>How long do you think</p>
<p>she will stay mad at me?</p>
<p>i don't know ...</p>
<p>just keep talking about that little ball,</p>
<p>and it might touch her in the heart ...</p>
<p>... and she will come around.</p>
<p>It's true. Every word.</p>
<p>This is gonna sound crazy.</p>
<p>But I think,thats why Dubledore left it to me</p>
<p>The delumin�tor.</p>
<p>I think somehow he knew</p>
<p>I'll need to find my way back</p>
<p>Hey, I just realized</p>
<p>you need a wand, don't yout?</p>
<p>I got one here.</p>
<p>Blackthorn 10 inches ,</p>
<p>nothing special.</p>
<p>But be uploaded with just. - I took off</p>
<p>a snatcher few weeks ago</p>
<p>Don't tell hermione this</p>
<p>Definitely was a troll,</p>
<p>by the smell of it.</p>
<p>Engorgio. </p>
<p>Finite </p>
<p>We need to talk.</p>
<p>Yeah, alright</p>
<p>I want to go see</p>
<p>Xenophilius Lovegood.</p>
<p>Sorry?</p>
<p>See this ? It is a letter</p>
<p>Dumbledore wrote to Grindelwald.</p>
<p>Look at the signature.</p>
<p>It's the mark again</p>
<p>It keeps cropping up.</p>
<p>in The tales of Beedle the Bard,</p>
<p>in the graveyard in Godric's Hollow ...</p>
<p>it was there too.</p>
<p>Where?</p>
<p>Outside Gregorvitch's wandshop.</p>
<p>What dors it mean?</p>
<p>Look...</p>
<p>You have no idea where the next Horcrux is</p>
<p>, and neither I do</p>
<p>But this,</p>
<p>this means something.</p>
<p>I am sure of it.</p>
<p>Yeah. Hermione's right.</p>
<p>We ought to see Lovegood</p>
<p>Lets vote.</p>
<p>Those in favor.</p>

<p>I am always mad at him</p>

<p>we met a few months ago.</p>

<p>Where is Luna?</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>She will be along.</p>
<p>So...how can I</p>
<p>help you, Mr Potter ?</p>
<p>Well, actually ...</p>
<p>... it was about something that you were wearing</p>
<p>around your neck at the wedding. A symbol.</p>
<p>You mean this?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>That's it exactly</p>
<p>What I wonder is ...</p>
<p>what is it?</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>Well.. its the sign of</p>
<p>the deathly hallows ofcourse .</p>
<p>The What?</p>
<p>The What?</p>
<p>The Deathly Hallows. I assume you are all</p>
<p>familiar with the tale of the three brothers?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I have it in here.</p>
<p>There were once three brothers,</p>
<p>who were travelling along a lonely</p>
<p>winding road ...</p>
<p>... at twilight</p>
<p>Midnight.</p>
<p>Mom always said midnight.</p>
<p>Twilight is fine.</p>
<p>better actually.</p>
<p>There were once three brothers,</p>
<p>who were travelling along a lonely</p>
<p>winding road ...</p>
<p>... at twilight.</p>
<p>In time the brothers reached a</p>
<p>river too treacherous to pass</p>
<p>But they were learned in the magical arts</p>
<p>the three brothers simply waved their wands..</p>
<p>... and made a bridge.</p>
<p>Before they could cross however they</p>
<p>found their path blocked by a hooded figure.</p>
<p>It was Death</p>
<p>And he felt cheated</p>
<p>Cheated, because travelers</p>
<p>usually drowned in the river.</p>
<p>But Death was cunning.</p>
<p>he pretended to congratulate</p>
<p>the three brothers .on their magic..</p>
<p>... and said,</p>
<p>that each had earned a prize ...</p>
<p>... for being clever enough</p>
<p>to evade him</p>
<p>the oldest asked for a wand,</p>
<p>more powerful than any in existence</p>
<p>so death fashioned him a wand</p>
<p>from the elder tree that stood nearby</p>
<p>The second brother he decided</p>
<p>he wanted to humiliate death</p>
<p>even further..</p>
<p>... and asked for the power</p>
<p>to recall loved ones from</p>
<p>their graves</p>
<p>So Death picked a stone from the river</p>
<p>and offered it to him.</p>
<p>Finally, Death turned to</p>
<p>the third brother.</p>
<p>A humble man, asked for something</p>
<p>that allowed him to go from that place...</p>
<p>...without being followed</p>
<p>by death</p>
<p>And so it was that death reluctantly</p>
<p>handed over his own cloak of</p>
<p>invisibility</p>
<p>The first brother travelled</p>
<p>to a distant village...</p>
<p>... with the elder wand in his hand</p>
<p>he killed a wizard with whom he once had quarrels..</p>
<p>Drunk with the power that</p>
<p>the elder wand had given him..</p>
<p>... he bragged about it</p>
<p>You shall not prevail against his nose? ou.</p>
<p>But that night ...</p>
<p>...another wizard stole the wand</p>
<p>and slit the brothers throat for good measure.</p>
<p>And so the death took the first brother.</p>
<p>for his own</p>
<p>The second brother journeyed home,</p>
<p>where he took the stone and</p>
<p>turned it thrice in his hand</p>
<p>To his delight the girl he once</p>
<p>wanted to marry before her untimely death...</p>
<p>... appeared before him.</p>
<p>But soon she turned sad and cold</p>
<p>because she did not belong to the mortal world</p>
<p>Driven mad with hopeless longing</p>
<p>the second brother killed himself</p>
<p>so as to join her</p>
<p>And so death took the second brother</p>
<p>As for the third brother Death</p>
<p>searched for many years</p>
<p>but was never able to find him</p>
<p>only when he had attained a great age the</p>
<p>youngest brother shed the cloak of invisibilty</p>
<p>and gave it to his son ...</p>
<p>.. he then greeted death</p>
<p>as a old friend</p>
<p>and went with him gladly</p>
<p>departing this life as equals</p>
<p>so there we are</p>
<p>Those are the Deathly Hallows.</p>
<p>I'm sorry sir,</p>
<p>I still don't quite understand.</p>
<p>The Elder wand ...</p>
<p>... the most powerful wand</p>
<p>ever made.</p>
<p>The resurrection stone</p>
<p>The cloak of invisibility</p>
<p>Together, they make the Deathly Hallows.</p>
<p>Together they make one</p>
<p>master of death.</p>
<p>That mark was on the grave in</p>
<p>Godrics Hollow.</p>
<p>Mr. Lovegood, does the Peverell</p>
<p>family have something to do with</p>
<p>the deathly hallows</p>
<p>Yes, Ignotus, and his brothers</p>
<p>Cadmus and Antioch were the original owner of the hallows ...</p>
<p>... and therefore inspiration for the story.</p>
<p>Your tea has gone cold</p>
<p>Don't go</p>
<p>I'll be right back?.</p>
<p>Let's get out of here .</p>
<p>I have more of this �brndy pi? I will not.</p>
<p>Thank you for ...</p>

<p>You do not have to,</p>
<p>we should be going any way.</p>
<p>No, you do not!</p>
<p>Sir?</p>
<p>You are my only hope.</p>
<p>They were angry, you see,</p>
<p>because of what I've been writing.</p>
<p>so they took ...</p>
<p>... took my children.</p>
<p>my children</p>
<p>?</p>
<p>Who took her, sir?</p>
<p>Voldemort.</p>
<p>I got it!</p>
<p>treacherous little bleeder!</p>
<p>is there no one we can trust?</p>
<p>they kidnapped her</p>
<p>because he supported me.</p>
<p>He was just desperate.</p>
<p>I'll do the enchantments.</p>
<p>Hello beautiful.</p>
<p>Don;t just hang back</p>
<p>Snatch them</p>
<p>Harry.</p>
<p>Tell me. what to do Tell me, where it is. </p>
<p>Grindelwald.</p>
<p>Grindelwald.</p>

<p>I knew</p>
<p>that one day you come.</p>
<p>But surely as you know.</p>
<p>i no longer have what you seek.</p>
<p>I believe you Grindelwald,</p>
<p>tell me where it is</p>
<p>Tell me who posseses it.</p>
<p>The elder wand lies with him</p>
<p>ofcourse...</p>
<p>Buried in the earth.</p>
<p>with Dumbledore.</p>
<p>The hallows exist</p>
<p>He is only after one... the last one</p>
<p>He knows where it is.</p>
<p>he's gonna have it by the end of the night?.</p>
<p>you know who's had the elder wand.</p>
