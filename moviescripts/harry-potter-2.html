<h2>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</h2>
<p>I can't let you out, Hedwig.</p>
<p>I'm not allowed to use magic outside of school.</p>
<p>Besides, if Uncle Vernon...</p>
<p>Harry Potter!</p>
<p>Now you've done it.</p>
<p>He's in there. Vernon?</p>
<p>I'm warning you, if you can't control that bloody bird, it'll have to go.</p>
<p>But she's bored.</p>
<p>If I could only let her out for an hour or two.</p>
<p>So you can send secret messages to your freaky little friends?</p>
<p>No, sir.</p>
<p>But I haven't had any messages from any of my friends.</p>
<p>Not one... all summer.</p>
<p>Who would want to be friends with you?</p>
<p>I should think you'd be a little more grateful.</p>
<p>We've raised you since you were a baby, given you the food off our table... even let you have Dudley's second bedroom... purely out of the goodness of our hearts.</p>
<p>Not now.</p>
<p>It's for when the Masons arrive.</p>
<p>Which should be any minute.</p>
<p>Now, let's go over our schedule</p>
<p>once again, shall we?</p>
<p>Petunia, when the Masons arrive,</p>
<p>you will be...?</p>
<p>In the lounge, waiting to welcome</p>
<p>them graciously to our home.</p>
<p>Good. And, Dudley, you will be...?</p>
<p>I'll be waiting to open the door.</p>
<p>Excellent.</p>
<p>And you?</p>
<p>I'll be in my bedroom, making no noise</p>
<p>and pretending that I don't exist.</p>
<p>Too right, you will.</p>
<p>With any luck, this could be the day</p>
<p>I make the biggest deal of my career...</p>
<p>...and you will not mess it up.</p>
<p>Harry Potter, such an honor it is.</p>
<p>Who are you?</p>
<p>Dobby, sir. Dobby the house-elf.</p>
<p>Not to be rude or anything...</p>
<p>...but this isn't a great time for me</p>
<p>to have a house-elf in my bedroom.</p>
<p>Yes, sir. Dobby understands.</p>
<p>It's just that Dobby</p>
<p>has come to tell you...</p>
<p>It is difficult, sir.</p>
<p>Dobby wonders where to begin.</p>
<p>Why don't you sit down?</p>
<p>Sit down? Sit down?</p>
<p>Dobby, I'm sorry. I didn't mean</p>
<p>to offend you or anything.</p>
<p>Offend Dobby?</p>
<p>Dobby has heard</p>
<p>of your greatness, sir...</p>
<p>...but never has he been asked</p>
<p>to sit down by a wizard, like an equal.</p>
<p>You can't have met</p>
<p>many decent wizards then.</p>
<p>No, I haven't.</p>
<p>That was an awful thing to say.</p>
<p>Bad Dobby! Bad Dobby!</p>
<p>Stop, Dobby. Dobby, shush.</p>
<p>Dobby, please, stop.</p>
<p>Don't mind that. It's just the cat.</p>
<p>Bad Dobby.</p>
<p>Stop! Stop, Dobby. Please, be quiet.</p>
<p>Are you all right?</p>
<p>Dobby had to punish himself, sir.</p>
<p>Dobby almost spoke ill</p>
<p>of his family, sir.</p>
<p>Your family?</p>
<p>The wizard family Dobby serves, sir.</p>
<p>Dobby is bound to serve</p>
<p>one family forever.</p>
<p>If they ever knew Dobby was here...</p>
<p>But Dobby had to come. Dobby has</p>
<p>to protect Harry Potter. To warn him.</p>
<p>Harry Potter must not go back...</p>
<p>...to Hogwarts School</p>
<p>of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year.</p>
<p>There is a plot, a plot to make</p>
<p>most terrible things happen.</p>
<p>What terrible things?</p>
<p>Who's plotting them?</p>
<p>Can't say.</p>
<p>Okay, I understand. You can't say.</p>
<p>Don't make me talk. L...</p>
<p>Dobby. Dobby, put the lamp down.</p>
<p>Bad Dobby.</p>
<p>So when they arrive</p>
<p>at the ninth hole...</p>
<p>Give me the lamp.</p>
<p>Dobby, stop!</p>
<p>Let me go.</p>
<p>Get in there and keep quiet.</p>
<p>What the devil are you doing up here?</p>
<p>I was just...</p>
<p>You just ruined the punch line</p>
<p>of my Japanese golfer joke.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>One more sound and you'll wish</p>
<p>you'd never been born, boy.</p>
<p>And fix that door.</p>
<p>Yes, sir.</p>
<p>See why I've got to go back?</p>
<p>I don't belong here.</p>
<p>I belong in your world, at Hogwarts.</p>
<p>It's the only place I've got friends.</p>
<p>Friends who don't write to Harry Potter?</p>
<p>Well, I expect they've been...</p>
<p>Hang on. How do you know</p>
<p>my friends haven't been writing to me?</p>
<p>Harry Potter mustn't</p>
<p>be angry with Dobby.</p>
<p>Dobby hoped if Harry Potter</p>
<p>thought his friends had forgotten him...</p>
<p>...Harry Potter might not want</p>
<p>to go back to school, sir.</p>
<p>Give me those. Now.</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>Dobby, get back here.</p>
<p>Dobby, please, no.</p>
<p>Harry Potter must say</p>
<p>he's not going back to school.</p>
<p>I can't. Hogwarts is my home.</p>
<p>Then Dobby must do it, sir,</p>
<p>for Harry Potter's own good.</p>
<p>It spread as far as the eye could see,</p>
<p>all over the floor of this building.</p>
<p>One plumber said,</p>
<p>"Look at all that water."</p>
<p>The second plumber said,</p>
<p>"Yes, and that's just the top of it."</p>
<p>I'm so sorry. It's my nephew.</p>
<p>He's very disturbed.</p>
<p>Meeting strangers upsets him.</p>
<p>That's why I kept him upstairs.</p>
<p>You're never going back to that school.</p>
<p>You're never going to see those</p>
<p>freaky friends of yours again. Never!</p>
<p>Hiya, Harry.</p>
<p>Ron. Fred. George.</p>
<p>What are you all doing here?</p>
<p>Rescuing you, of course.</p>
<p>Now, come on, get your trunk.</p>
<p>You better stand back.</p>
<p>Let's go.</p>
<p>What was that?</p>
<p>What was it?</p>
<p>Potter!</p>
<p>Dad, what's going on?</p>
<p>Go. Go. Go.</p>
<p>Dad, hurry up.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>Come on, Harry, hurry up.</p>
<p>Petunia, he's escaping!</p>
<p>I've got you, Harry.</p>
<p>Come here!</p>
<p>Let go of me!</p>
<p>No, boy!</p>
<p>You and that bloody pigeon</p>
<p>aren't going anywhere.</p>
<p>Get off!</p>
<p>Drive!</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Right!</p>
<p>No! No! No! No!</p>
<p>Dad!</p>
<p>Damn.</p>
<p>By the way, Harry, happy birthday.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>Okay, come on.</p>
<p>Okay, come on.</p>
<p>Think it'd be all right if we had some?</p>
<p>Yeah, Mum will never know.</p>
<p>It's not much, but it's home.</p>
<p>I think it's brilliant.</p>
<p>Where have you been?</p>
<p>Harry, how wonderful</p>
<p>to see you, dear.</p>
<p>Beds empty. No note. Car gone.</p>
<p>You could have died.</p>
<p>You could have been seen.</p>
<p>Of course, I don't</p>
<p>blame you, Harry, dear.</p>
<p>They were starving him, Mum.</p>
<p>There were bars on his window.</p>
<p>Well, you best hope I don't put bars</p>
<p>on your window, Ronald Weasley.</p>
<p>Come on, Harry,</p>
<p>time for a spot of breakfast.</p>
<p>Here we are, Harry. Now, tuck in.</p>
<p>That's it. There we go.</p>
<p>Mummy, have you seen my jumper?</p>
<p>Yes, dear, it was on the cat.</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>What did I do?</p>
<p>Ginny. She's been talking about you</p>
<p>all summer. A bit annoying, really.</p>
<p>Morning, Weasleys.</p>
<p>Morning, Dad.</p>
<p>What a night. Nine raids. Nine!</p>
<p>Raids?</p>
<p>Dad works in the Ministry of Magic,</p>
<p>in the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office.</p>
<p>Dad loves Muggles,</p>
<p>thinks they're fascinating.</p>
<p>Well, now.</p>
<p>And who are you?</p>
<p>Sorry, sir. I'm Harry, sir.</p>
<p>Harry Potter.</p>
<p>Good Lord. Are you really?</p>
<p>Well, Ron has told us all about you,</p>
<p>of course. When did he get here?</p>
<p>This morning.</p>
<p>Your sons flew that enchanted car</p>
<p>of yours to Surrey and back last night.</p>
<p>Did you really? How did it go?</p>
<p>I mean... That was very wrong</p>
<p>indeed, boys. Very wrong of you.</p>
<p>Now, Harry, you must know</p>
<p>all about Muggles.</p>
<p>Tell me, what exactly</p>
<p>is the function of a rubber duck?</p>
<p>Well, that'll be Errol with the post.</p>
<p>Fetch it, will you, Percy, please?</p>
<p>Errol.</p>
<p>He's always doing that.</p>
<p>Look, it's our Hogwarts letters.</p>
<p>They've sent us Harry's as well.</p>
<p>Dumbledore must know you're here.</p>
<p>Doesn't miss a trick, that man.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>This lot won't come cheap.</p>
<p>The spell books alone are expensive.</p>
<p>We'll manage.</p>
<p>There's only one place we're going to</p>
<p>get all of this. Diagon Alley.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Here we are, Harry.</p>
<p>You go first, dear.</p>
<p>But Harry's never traveled</p>
<p>by Floo powder before, Mum.</p>
<p>Floo powder?</p>
<p>You go first, Ron, so that Harry</p>
<p>can see how it's done. Yes.</p>
<p>In you go.</p>
<p>That's it.</p>
<p>Diagon Alley.</p>
<p>You see? It's quite easy, dear.</p>
<p>Don't be afraid. Come on.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>In you go. That's it. Mind your head.</p>
<p>That's right.</p>
<p>Now, take your Floo powder.</p>
<p>That's it, very good.</p>
<p>Now, don't forget to speak</p>
<p>very, very clearly.</p>
<p>Diagonally.</p>
<p>What did he say, dear?</p>
<p>Diagonally.</p>
<p>I thought he did.</p>
<p>Not lost, are you, my dear?</p>
<p>I'm fine, thank you. I was just going...</p>
<p>Come with us. We'll help you</p>
<p>find your way back.</p>
<p>No. Please...</p>
<p>Harry?</p>
<p>Hagrid!</p>
<p>What do you think</p>
<p>you're doing down here? Come on.</p>
<p>You're a mess, Harry. Skulking around</p>
<p>Knockturn Alley? Dodgy place.</p>
<p>Don't want no one to see you there.</p>
<p>People will think you're up to no good.</p>
<p>I was lost, l...</p>
<p>Hang on. What were you</p>
<p>doing down there then?</p>
<p>Me? I was... I was looking</p>
<p>for Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent.</p>
<p>They're ruining all the school cabbages.</p>
<p>Harry. Hagrid.</p>
<p>Hello, Hermione.</p>
<p>It's so good to see you.</p>
<p>It's great to see you too.</p>
<p>What did you do to your glasses?</p>
<p>Oculus Reparo.</p>
<p>I definitely need to remember that one.</p>
<p>You'll be all right now then, Harry?</p>
<p>Right. I'll leave you to it.</p>
<p>Okay, bye.</p>
<p>Thank you. Bye.</p>
<p>Come on, everyone's been so worried.</p>
<p>Harry.</p>
<p>Thank goodness. We'd hoped</p>
<p>you'd only gone one grate too far.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p>
<p>Mr. Gilderoy Lockhart.</p>
<p>Here he is.</p>
<p>Mum fancies him.</p>
<p>Make way there, please.</p>
<p>Let me by, madam. Thank you.</p>
<p>Excuse me, little girl.</p>
<p>This is for the Daily Prophet.</p>
<p>It can't be. Harry Potter?</p>
<p>Harry Potter!</p>
<p>Excuse me, madam.</p>
<p>Nice big smile, Harry.</p>
<p>Together, you and I rate the front page.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p>
<p>what an extraordinary moment this is.</p>
<p>When young Harry stepped</p>
<p>into Flourish and Blotts this morning...</p>
<p>...to purchase my autobiography,</p>
<p>Magical Me...</p>
<p>...which, incidentally,</p>
<p>is currently celebrating...</p>
<p>...its 27th week atop</p>
<p>the Daily Prophet bestseller list...</p>
<p>...he had no idea that he would,</p>
<p>in fact, be leaving...</p>
<p>...with my entire collected works...</p>
<p>...free of charge.</p>
<p>Now, ladies?</p>
<p>Harry, now you give me those,</p>
<p>and I'll get them signed.</p>
<p>All of you wait outside.</p>
<p>That's it.</p>
<p>I'll bet you loved that,</p>
<p>didn't you, Potter?</p>
<p>Famous Harry Potter. Can't go into a</p>
<p>bookshop without making the front page.</p>
<p>Leave him alone.</p>
<p>Look, Potter.</p>
<p>You've got yourself a girlfriend.</p>
<p>Now, now, Draco, play nicely.</p>
<p>Mr. Potter.</p>
<p>Lucius Malfoy. We meet at last.</p>
<p>Forgive me.</p>
<p>Your scar is legend.</p>
<p>As, of course, is the wizard</p>
<p>who gave it to you.</p>
<p>Voldemort killed my parents.</p>
<p>He was nothing more than a murderer.</p>
<p>You must be very brave</p>
<p>to mention his name.</p>
<p>Or very foolish.</p>
<p>Fear of a name only increases</p>
<p>fear of the thing itself.</p>
<p>And you must be Miss Granger.</p>
<p>Yes, Draco has told me</p>
<p>all about you. And your parents.</p>
<p>Muggles, aren't they?</p>
<p>Let me see.</p>
<p>Red hair, vacant expressions...</p>
<p>...tatty, secondhand book.</p>
<p>You must be the Weasleys.</p>
<p>It's mad in here.</p>
<p>Let's go outside.</p>
<p>Well, well, well. Weasley senior.</p>
<p>Lucius.</p>
<p>Busy time at the Ministry, Arthur,</p>
<p>all those extra raids?</p>
<p>I do hope they're paying you overtime...</p>
<p>...but judging by the state of this,</p>
<p>I'd say not.</p>
<p>What's the use in being a disgrace</p>
<p>to the name of wizard...</p>
<p>...if they don't even pay you well for it?</p>
<p>We have a very different idea about what</p>
<p>disgraces the name of wizard, Malfoy.</p>
<p>Clearly.</p>
<p>Associating with Muggles.</p>
<p>And I thought your family</p>
<p>could sink no lower.</p>
<p>I'll see you at work.</p>
<p>See you at school.</p>
<p>10:58, come on.</p>
<p>The train will be leaving any moment.</p>
<p>Fred, George, Percy, you first.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>After you, dear.</p>
<p>Come on, Ginny,</p>
<p>we'll get you a seat. Hurry.</p>
<p>Let's go.</p>
<p>What do you two think you're doing?</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>Lost control of the trolley.</p>
<p>Why can't we get through?</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>The gateway has sealed</p>
<p>itself for some reason.</p>
<p>The train leaves at exactly 11:00.</p>
<p>We've missed it.</p>
<p>Harry, if we can't get through...</p>
<p>...maybe Mum and Dad can't get back.</p>
<p>Maybe we should just go</p>
<p>and wait by the car.</p>
<p>The car.</p>
<p>Ron, I should tell you...</p>
<p>...most Muggles aren't accustomed</p>
<p>to seeing a flying car.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Oh, no! The Invisibility Booster</p>
<p>must be faulty.</p>
<p>Come on, then. Let's go lower.</p>
<p>We need to find the train.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>All we need to do is catch up</p>
<p>with the train.</p>
<p>We can't be far behind.</p>
<p>Do you hear that?</p>
<p>We must be getting close.</p>
<p>Hold on.</p>
<p>Harry!</p>
<p>Hold on!</p>
<p>Take my hand!</p>
<p>Hold on!</p>
<p>I'm trying. Your hand's all sweaty.</p>
<p>I think we found the train.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Welcome home.</p>
<p>Up! Up!</p>
<p>It's not working!</p>
<p>Up! Ron, mind that tree!</p>
<p>Stop! Stop! Stop!</p>
<p>My wand. Look at my wand.</p>
<p>Be thankful it's not your neck.</p>
<p>What's happening?</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>Come on, go! Fast!</p>
<p>Scabbers, you're okay.</p>
<p>The car!</p>
<p>Dad's gonna kill me.</p>
<p>See you, Hedwig.</p>
<p>So a house-elf shows up</p>
<p>in my bedroom...</p>
<p>...we can't get through the barrier</p>
<p>to platform 93/4...</p>
<p>...we almost get killed by a tree...</p>
<p>Clearly someone doesn't want me</p>
<p>here this year.</p>
<p>Well, take a good look, lads.</p>
<p>This night might well be</p>
<p>the last you spend in this castle.</p>
<p>Oh, dear, we are in trouble.</p>
<p>You were seen by no less</p>
<p>than seven Muggles.</p>
<p>Do you have any idea</p>
<p>how serious this is?</p>
<p>You have risked</p>
<p>the exposure of our world.</p>
<p>Not to mention the damage you</p>
<p>inflicted on a Whomping Willow...</p>
<p>...that's been on these grounds</p>
<p>since before you were born.</p>
<p>Honestly, Professor Snape,</p>
<p>I think it did more damage to us.</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>I assure you that were you in Slytherin,</p>
<p>and your fate rested with me...</p>
<p>...the both of you would be</p>
<p>on the train home tonight.</p>
<p>As it is...</p>
<p>They are not.</p>
<p>Professor Dumbledore.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall.</p>
<p>Headmaster...</p>
<p>...these boys have flouted the Decree</p>
<p>for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry.</p>
<p>As such...</p>
<p>I am well aware of our bylaws...</p>
<p>...having written</p>
<p>quite a few of them myself.</p>
<p>However, as head of Gryffindor house...</p>
<p>...it is for Professor McGonagall</p>
<p>to determine the appropriate action.</p>
<p>We'll go and get our stuff, then.</p>
<p>What are you</p>
<p>talking about, Mr. Weasley?</p>
<p>You're going to expel us, aren't you?</p>
<p>Not today, Mr. Weasley...</p>
<p>...but I must impress on both of you</p>
<p>the seriousness of what you have done.</p>
<p>I will be writing to your families tonight,</p>
<p>and you will both receive detention.</p>
<p>Morning, everyone.</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone.</p>
<p>Good morning, Professor Sprout.</p>
<p>Welcome to Greenhouse Three,</p>
<p>second years. Gather around, everyone.</p>
<p>Today we're going to re-pot Mandrakes.</p>
<p>Who here can tell me</p>
<p>the properties of the Mandrake root?</p>
<p>Yes, Miss Granger?</p>
<p>Mandrake, or Mandragora...</p>
<p>...is used to return those who have been</p>
<p>Petrified to their original state.</p>
<p>It's also dangerous. The Mandrake's</p>
<p>cry is fatal to anyone who hears it.</p>
<p>Excellent. Ten points to Gryffindor.</p>
<p>As our Mandrakes</p>
<p>are still only seedlings...</p>
<p>...their cries won't kill you yet.</p>
<p>But they could knock you out for hours,</p>
<p>which is why I have given you earmuffs...</p>
<p>...for auditory protection.</p>
<p>So could you please put them on,</p>
<p>right away? Quickly.</p>
<p>Flaps tight down,</p>
<p>and watch me closely.</p>
<p>You grasp your Mandrake firmly.</p>
<p>You pull it sharply up out of the pot.</p>
<p>Got it? And...</p>
<p>...now you dunk it down</p>
<p>into the other pot...</p>
<p>...and pour a little sprinkling of soil</p>
<p>to keep him warm.</p>
<p>Longbottom's been neglecting</p>
<p>his earmuffs.</p>
<p>No, ma'am, he's just fainted.</p>
<p>Yes, well, just leave him there.</p>
<p>Right, on we go.</p>
<p>Plenty of pots to go around.</p>
<p>Grasp your Mandrake and pull it up.</p>
<p>There's Nearly Headless Nick.</p>
<p>Hello, Percy, Miss Clearwater.</p>
<p>Hello, Sir Nicholas.</p>
<p>Say it. I'm doomed.</p>
<p>You're doomed.</p>
<p>Hi, Harry.</p>
<p>I'm Colin Creevey. I'm in Gryffindor too.</p>
<p>Hi, Colin. Nice to meet you.</p>
<p>Ron, is that your owl?</p>
<p>Bloody bird's a menace.</p>
<p>Oh, no.</p>
<p>Look, everyone.</p>
<p>Weasley's got himself a Howler.</p>
<p>Go on, Ron. I ignored one</p>
<p>from my gran once. It was horrible.</p>
<p>Ronald Weasley!</p>
<p>How dare you steal that car!</p>
<p>I am absolutely disgusted!</p>
<p>Your father's now facing</p>
<p>an inquiry at work...</p>
<p>... and it's entirely your fault!</p>
<p>If you put another toe out of line...</p>
<p>... we'll bring you straight home!</p>
<p>And, Ginny, dear, congratulations</p>
<p>on making Gryffindor.</p>
<p>Your father and I are so proud.</p>
<p>Let me introduce you to your new</p>
<p>Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.</p>
<p>Me.</p>
<p>Gilderoy Lockhart...</p>
<p>...Order of Merlin, Third Class...</p>
<p>...honorary member</p>
<p>of the Dark Force Defense League...</p>
<p>...and five times winner...</p>
<p>...of Witch Weekly's</p>
<p>Most-Charming-Smile Award.</p>
<p>But I don't talk about that.</p>
<p>I didn't get rid of the Bandon Banshee</p>
<p>by smiling at him.</p>
<p>Now, be warned.</p>
<p>It is my job to arm you...</p>
<p>...against the foulest creatures</p>
<p>known to wizardkind.</p>
<p>You may find yourselves facing</p>
<p>your worst fears in this room.</p>
<p>Know only that no harm</p>
<p>can befall you whilst I am here.</p>
<p>I must ask you not to scream.</p>
<p>It might provoke them.</p>
<p>Cornish pixies?</p>
<p>Freshly caught Cornish pixies.</p>
<p>Laugh if you will, Mr. Finnegan...</p>
<p>...but pixies can be</p>
<p>devilishly tricky little blighters.</p>
<p>Let's see what you make of them.</p>
<p>Come on now, round them up.</p>
<p>They're only pixies.</p>
<p>You just stay there!</p>
<p>Please, get me down!</p>
<p>Get off me!</p>
<p>Stop. Hold still!</p>
<p>Peskipiksi Pesternomi!</p>
<p>I'll ask you three to just nip</p>
<p>the rest of them back into their cage.</p>
<p>What do we do now?</p>
<p>Immobulus!</p>
<p>Why is it always me?</p>
<p>I spent the summer devising</p>
<p>a whole new Quidditch program.</p>
<p>We're gonna train earlier,</p>
<p>harder and longer.</p>
<p>What...? I don't believe it.</p>
<p>Where you think you're going, Flint?</p>
<p>Quidditch practice.</p>
<p>I booked the pitch for Gryffindor today.</p>
<p>Easy, Wood. I've got a note.</p>
<p>I smell trouble.</p>
<p>"I, Professor Severus Snape,</p>
<p>do hereby give the Slytherin team...</p>
<p>...permission to practice today, owing</p>
<p>to the need to train their new Seeker."</p>
<p>You've got a new Seeker. Who?</p>
<p>Malfoy?</p>
<p>That's right.</p>
<p>And that's not all</p>
<p>that's new this year.</p>
<p>Those are Nimbus 2001 s.</p>
<p>How did you get those?</p>
<p>A gift from Draco's father.</p>
<p>You see, Weasley, unlike some,</p>
<p>my father can afford the best.</p>
<p>At least no one on the Gryffindor team</p>
<p>had to buy their way in.</p>
<p>They got in on pure talent.</p>
<p>No one asked your opinion,</p>
<p>you filthy little Mudblood.</p>
<p>You'll pay for that one, Malfoy.</p>
<p>Eat slugs!</p>
<p>You okay, Ron?</p>
<p>Say something.</p>
<p>Wow! Can you turn him around, Harry?</p>
<p>No, Colin, get out of the way.</p>
<p>Let's take him to Hagrid's.</p>
<p>He'll know what to do.</p>
<p>This calls for</p>
<p>a specialist's equipment.</p>
<p>Nothing to do but wait till it stops,</p>
<p>I'm afraid.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Better out than in.</p>
<p>Who was Ron trying to curse, anyway?</p>
<p>Malfoy. He called Hermione...</p>
<p>Well, I don't know</p>
<p>exactly what it means.</p>
<p>He called me a Mudblood.</p>
<p>He did not.</p>
<p>What's a Mudblood?</p>
<p>It means "dirty blood." Mudblood's a foul</p>
<p>name for someone who's Muggle-born.</p>
<p>Someone with non-magic parents.</p>
<p>Someone like me.</p>
<p>It's not a term one usually hears</p>
<p>in civilized conversation.</p>
<p>See, the thing is, Harry, there are</p>
<p>some wizards, like the Malfoy family...</p>
<p>...who think they're better than everyone</p>
<p>else because they're pure-blood.</p>
<p>That's horrible.</p>
<p>It's disgusting.</p>
<p>And it's codswallop to boot.</p>
<p>Dirty blood.</p>
<p>Why, there isn't a wizard alive today</p>
<p>that's not half-blood or less.</p>
<p>More to the point, they've yet to think</p>
<p>of a spell that our Hermione can't do.</p>
<p>Come here.</p>
<p>Don't you think on it, Hermione.</p>
<p>Don't you think on it for one minute.</p>
<p>Harry, Harry, Harry.</p>
<p>Can you possibly imagine...</p>
<p>...a better way to serve detention...</p>
<p>...than by helping me</p>
<p>to answer my fan mail?</p>
<p>Not really.</p>
<p>Fame is a fickle friend, Harry.</p>
<p>Celebrity is as celebrity does.</p>
<p>Remember that.</p>
<p>Come.</p>
<p>Come...</p>
<p>... to me.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Sorry?</p>
<p>That voice.</p>
<p>Voice?</p>
<p>Didn't you hear it?</p>
<p>What are you talking about, Harry?</p>
<p>I think you're getting</p>
<p>a bit drowsy.</p>
<p>And great Scott, no wonder. Look at the</p>
<p>time. We've been here nearly four hours.</p>
<p>Spooky how the time flies</p>
<p>when one is having fun.</p>
<p>Spooky.</p>
<p>Blood.</p>
<p>I smell blood.</p>
<p>Let me rip you.</p>
<p>Let me kill you.</p>
<p>Kill!</p>
<p>Kill!</p>
<p>Kill!</p>
<p>Harry!</p>
<p>Did you hear it?</p>
<p>Hear what?</p>
<p>That voice.</p>
<p>Voice? What voice?</p>
<p>I heard it first in Lockhart's office.</p>
<p>And then again just...</p>
<p>It's time.</p>
<p>It's moving.</p>
<p>I think it's going to kill.</p>
<p>Kill?</p>
<p>Harry, wait! Not so fast!</p>
<p>Strange.</p>
<p>I've never seen spiders act like that.</p>
<p>I don't like spiders.</p>
<p>What's that?</p>
<p>"The Chamber of Secrets has been</p>
<p>opened. Enemies of the Heir, beware."</p>
<p>It's written in blood.</p>
<p>Oh, no.</p>
<p>It's Filch's cat.</p>
<p>It's Mrs. Norris.</p>
<p>"Enemies of the Heir, beware."</p>
<p>You'll be next, Mudbloods.</p>
<p>What's going on here?</p>
<p>Go on. Make way, make way.</p>
<p>Potter?</p>
<p>What are you...?</p>
<p>Mrs. Norris?</p>
<p>You've murdered my cat.</p>
<p>No. No.</p>
<p>I'll kill you.</p>
<p>I'll kill you!</p>
<p>Argus!</p>
<p>Argus, I...</p>
<p>Everyone will proceed</p>
<p>to their dormitories immediately.</p>
<p>Everyone except...</p>
<p>...you three.</p>
<p>Ravenclaws, follow me.</p>
<p>She's not dead, Argus.</p>
<p>She has been Petrified.</p>
<p>Thought so.</p>
<p>So unlucky I wasn't there.</p>
<p>I know exactly the countercurse</p>
<p>that could've spared her.</p>
<p>But how she has been Petrified,</p>
<p>I cannot say.</p>
<p>Ask him.</p>
<p>It's him that's done it.</p>
<p>You saw what he wrote on the wall.</p>
<p>It's not true, sir. I swear.</p>
<p>I never touched Mrs. Norris.</p>
<p>Rubbish.</p>
<p>Lf I might, headmaster?</p>
<p>Perhaps Potter and his friends were just</p>
<p>in the wrong place at the wrong time.</p>
<p>However...</p>
<p>...the circumstances are suspicious.</p>
<p>I, for one, don't recall</p>
<p>seeing Potter at dinner.</p>
<p>I'm afraid that's my doing, Severus.</p>
<p>You see, Harry was helping me</p>
<p>answer my fan mail.</p>
<p>That's why Ron and I</p>
<p>went looking for him, professor.</p>
<p>We'd just found him when he said...</p>
<p>Yes, Miss Granger?</p>
<p>When I said I wasn't hungry.</p>
<p>We were heading back to the common</p>
<p>room when we found Mrs. Norris.</p>
<p>Innocent until proven guilty, Severus.</p>
<p>My cat has been Petrified.</p>
<p>I want to see some punishment!</p>
<p>We will be able to cure her, Argus.</p>
<p>As I understand it, Madam Sprout</p>
<p>has a very healthy growth of Mandrake.</p>
<p>When matured, a potion will be made</p>
<p>which will revive Mrs. Norris.</p>
<p>And in the meantime...</p>
<p>...I strongly recommend caution...</p>
<p>...to all.</p>
<p>It's a bit strange, isn't it?</p>
<p>Strange?</p>
<p>You hear this voice,</p>
<p>a voice only you can hear...</p>
<p>...and then Mrs. Norris turns up</p>
<p>Petrified. It's just strange.</p>
<p>Do you think I should have told them?</p>
<p>Dumbledore and the others, I mean?</p>
<p>Are you mad?</p>
<p>No, Harry. Even in the wizarding world,</p>
<p>hearing voices isn't a good sign.</p>
<p>She's right, you know.</p>
<p>Could I have your attention,</p>
<p>please?</p>
<p>Right. Now, today,</p>
<p>we will be transforming animals...</p>
<p>...into water goblets.</p>
<p>Like so.</p>
<p>One, two, three.</p>
<p>Vera Verto.</p>
<p>Now it's your turn.</p>
<p>Who would like to go first?</p>
<p>Mr. Weasley.</p>
<p>"One, two, three. Vera Verto."</p>
<p>Vera Verto!</p>
<p>That wand needs replacing,</p>
<p>Mr. Weasley.</p>
<p>Yes, Miss Granger?</p>
<p>Professor...</p>
<p>...I was wondering if you could tell us</p>
<p>about the Chamber of Secrets.</p>
<p>Very well.</p>
<p>You all know, of course...</p>
<p>...that Hogwarts was founded</p>
<p>over a thousand years ago...</p>
<p>...by the four greatest witches</p>
<p>and wizards of the age:</p>
<p>Godric Gryffindor,</p>
<p>Helga Hufflepuff...</p>
<p>...Rowena Ravenclaw</p>
<p>and Salazar Slytherin.</p>
<p>Now, three of the founders</p>
<p>coexisted quite harmoniously.</p>
<p>One did not.</p>
<p>Three guesses who.</p>
<p>Salazar Slytherin wished to be</p>
<p>more selective...</p>
<p>...about the students admitted</p>
<p>to Hogwarts.</p>
<p>He believed magical learning should</p>
<p>be kept within all-magic families.</p>
<p>In other words, pure-bloods.</p>
<p>Unable to sway the others,</p>
<p>he decided to leave the school.</p>
<p>Now, according to legend...</p>
<p>...Slytherin had built</p>
<p>a hidden chamber in this castle...</p>
<p>...known as the Chamber of Secrets.</p>
<p>Though, shortly before departing,</p>
<p>he sealed it...</p>
<p>...until that time when his own</p>
<p>true Heir returned to the school.</p>
<p>The Heir alone...</p>
<p>...would be able to open the Chamber...</p>
<p>...and unleash the horror within,</p>
<p>and by so doing...</p>
<p>...purge the school</p>
<p>of all those who...</p>
<p>...in Slytherin's view,</p>
<p>were unworthy to study magic.</p>
<p>Muggle-borns.</p>
<p>Naturally, the school</p>
<p>has been searched many times.</p>
<p>No such chamber has been found.</p>
<p>Professor? What exactly does legend</p>
<p>tell us lies within the Chamber?</p>
<p>The Chamber is said to be home</p>
<p>to something...</p>
<p>...that only the Heir of Slytherin</p>
<p>can control.</p>
<p>It is said to be the home...</p>
<p>...of a monster.</p>
<p>Do you think it's true? Do you think</p>
<p>there really is a Chamber of Secrets?</p>
<p>Yes. Couldn't you tell? McGonagall's</p>
<p>worried. All the teachers are.</p>
<p>If there really is a Chamber of Secrets,</p>
<p>and it has been opened, that means...</p>
<p>The Heir of Slytherin has returned</p>
<p>to Hogwarts. The question is, who is it?</p>
<p>Let's think. Who do we know who</p>
<p>thinks all Muggle-borns are scum?</p>
<p>Lf you're talking about Malfoy...</p>
<p>Of course. You heard him.</p>
<p>"You'll be next, Mudbloods."</p>
<p>I heard him.</p>
<p>But Malfoy, the Heir of Slytherin?</p>
<p>Maybe Ron's right, Hermione.</p>
<p>I mean, look at his family.</p>
<p>The whole lot of them have been</p>
<p>in Slytherin for centuries.</p>
<p>Crabbe and Goyle must know.</p>
<p>Maybe we could trick them into telling.</p>
<p>Even they aren't that thick.</p>
<p>But there might be another way.</p>
<p>Mind you, it would be difficult.</p>
<p>Not to mention we'd be breaking</p>
<p>about 50 school rules...</p>
<p>...and it'll be dangerous.</p>
<p>Very dangerous.</p>
<p>Here it is.</p>
<p>The Polyjuice Potion.</p>
<p>"Properly brewed, the Polyjuice Potion</p>
<p>allows the drinker...</p>
<p>...to transform himself temporarily</p>
<p>into the physical form of another."</p>
<p>You mean if Harry and I drink that stuff,</p>
<p>we'll turn into Crabbe and Goyle?</p>
<p>Wicked! Malfoy will tell us anything.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>But it's tricky. I've never seen</p>
<p>a more complicated potion.</p>
<p>How long will it take to make?</p>
<p>A month.</p>
<p>A month?</p>
<p>But, Hermione,</p>
<p>if Malfoy is the Heir of Slytherin...</p>
<p>...he could attack half</p>
<p>the Muggle-borns in the school by then.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>But it's the only plan we've got.</p>
<p>Another goal for Slytherin!</p>
<p>They lead Gryffindor 90 to 30.</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>All right there, Scarhead?</p>
<p>Watch yourself, Harry!</p>
<p>Wood, look out!</p>
<p>Blimey! Harry's got himself</p>
<p>a rogue Bludger.</p>
<p>That's been tampered with, that has.</p>
<p>I'll stop it.</p>
<p>No! Even with a proper wand,</p>
<p>it's too risky. You could hit Harry.</p>
<p>Training for the ballet, Potter?</p>
<p>You'll never catch me, Potter.</p>
<p>Let's go.</p>
<p>Harry Potter has caught the Snitch.</p>
<p>Gryffindor wins!</p>
<p>Finite Incantatem!</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Are you okay?</p>
<p>No. I think my arm is broken.</p>
<p>Not to worry, Harry. I will fix</p>
<p>that arm of yours straightaway.</p>
<p>Not you.</p>
<p>Boy doesn't know what he's saying.</p>
<p>This won't hurt a bit.</p>
<p>Brackium Emendo!</p>
<p>Yes, well,</p>
<p>that can sometimes happen...</p>
<p>...but the point is...</p>
<p>...you can no longer feel any pain, and,</p>
<p>very clearly, the bones are not broken.</p>
<p>Broken? There's no bones left.</p>
<p>Much more flexible, though.</p>
<p>Mr. Malfoy, stop making such a fuss.</p>
<p>You can go. Out of my way.</p>
<p>Should have been brought</p>
<p>straight to me.</p>
<p>I can mend bones in a heartbeat,</p>
<p>but growing them back...</p>
<p>You will be able to, won't you?</p>
<p>I'll be able to, certainly.</p>
<p>But it'll be painful.</p>
<p>You're in for a rough night, Potter.</p>
<p>Regrowing bones is a nasty business.</p>
<p>What do you expect?</p>
<p>Pumpkin juice?</p>
<p>Kill.</p>
<p>Kill.</p>
<p>Time to kill.</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>Dobby?</p>
<p>Harry Potter should have listened</p>
<p>to Dobby.</p>
<p>Harry Potter should have gone back home</p>
<p>when he missed the train.</p>
<p>It was you. You stopped the barrier</p>
<p>from letting Ron and me through.</p>
<p>Indeed. Yes, sir.</p>
<p>You nearly got Ron and me expelled.</p>
<p>At least you would be away from here.</p>
<p>Harry Potter must go home.</p>
<p>Dobby thought his Bludger would be</p>
<p>enough to make Harry Potter see...</p>
<p>Your Bludger? You made</p>
<p>that Bludger chase after me?</p>
<p>Dobby feels most aggrieved, sir.</p>
<p>Dobby had to iron his hands.</p>
<p>You better clear off before my bones</p>
<p>come back, or I might strangle you.</p>
<p>Dobby is used to death threats, sir.</p>
<p>Dobby gets them five times a day</p>
<p>at home.</p>
<p>I don't suppose you could tell me</p>
<p>why you're trying to kill me?</p>
<p>Not kill you, sir.</p>
<p>Never kill you.</p>
<p>Dobby remembers how it was</p>
<p>before Harry Potter triumphed...</p>
<p>...over He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.</p>
<p>We house-elves were</p>
<p>treated like vermin, sir.</p>
<p>Of course, Dobby is still</p>
<p>treated like vermin.</p>
<p>Why do you wear that thing, Dobby?</p>
<p>This, sir? It is a mark</p>
<p>of the house-elf's enslavement.</p>
<p>Dobby can only be freed if his master</p>
<p>presents him with clothes.</p>
<p>Listen.</p>
<p>Listen!</p>
<p>Terrible things are</p>
<p>about to happen at Hogwarts.</p>
<p>Harry Potter must not stay here...</p>
<p>...now that history</p>
<p>is to repeat itself.</p>
<p>Repeat itself? You mean</p>
<p>this has happened before?</p>
<p>I shouldn't have said that.</p>
<p>Bad Dobby! Bad!</p>
<p>Stop it!</p>
<p>Stop it, Dobby!</p>
<p>Tell me. When did this happen before?</p>
<p>Who's doing it now?</p>
<p>Dobby cannot say, sir. Dobby</p>
<p>only wants Harry Potter to be safe.</p>
<p>No, Dobby. Tell me.</p>
<p>Who is it?</p>
<p>Put him here.</p>
<p>What happened?</p>
<p>There's been another attack.</p>
<p>I think he's been Petrified,</p>
<p>Madam Pomfrey.</p>
<p>Look. Perhaps he managed</p>
<p>to take a picture of his attacker.</p>
<p>What can this mean, Albus?</p>
<p>It means...</p>
<p>...that our students</p>
<p>are in great danger.</p>
<p>What should I tell the staff?</p>
<p>The truth.</p>
<p>Tell them Hogwarts</p>
<p>is no longer safe.</p>
<p>It is as we feared, Minerva.</p>
<p>The Chamber of Secrets</p>
<p>has indeed been opened again.</p>
<p>Again? You mean the Chamber</p>
<p>of Secrets has been opened before?</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>Don't you see?</p>
<p>Lucius Malfoy must have opened it</p>
<p>when he was at school here.</p>
<p>Now he's taught Draco how to do it.</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait for</p>
<p>the Polyjuice Potion to know for sure.</p>
<p>Enlighten me. Why are we brewing</p>
<p>this potion in broad daylight...</p>
<p>...in the middle of the girls' lavatory?</p>
<p>Don't you think we'll get caught?</p>
<p>No. No one ever comes in here.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Moaning Myrtle.</p>
<p>Who?</p>
<p>Moaning Myrtle.</p>
<p>Who's Moaning Myrtle?</p>
<p>I'm Moaning Myrtle.</p>
<p>I wouldn't expect you to know me.</p>
<p>Who would ever talk</p>
<p>about ugly, miserable...</p>
<p>...moping Moaning Myrtle?</p>
<p>She's a little sensitive.</p>
<p>Gather round!</p>
<p>Gather round.</p>
<p>Can everybody see me?</p>
<p>Can you all hear me?</p>
<p>Excellent.</p>
<p>In light of the dark events</p>
<p>of recent weeks...</p>
<p>...Professor Dumbledore has granted me</p>
<p>permission to start this Dueling Club...</p>
<p>...to train you all up in case</p>
<p>you ever need to defend yourselves...</p>
<p>...as I myself have done</p>
<p>on countless occasions.</p>
<p>For full details,</p>
<p>see my published works.</p>
<p>Let me introduce my assistant...</p>
<p>...Professor Snape.</p>
<p>He has sportingly agreed to help</p>
<p>with a short demonstration.</p>
<p>I don't want any of you</p>
<p>youngsters to worry.</p>
<p>You'll still have your Potions master</p>
<p>when I'm through with him. Never fear.</p>
<p>One.</p>
<p>Two.</p>
<p>Three!</p>
<p>Expelliarmus!</p>
<p>Do you think he's all right?</p>
<p>Who cares?</p>
<p>An excellent idea to show them that,</p>
<p>Professor Snape...</p>
<p>...but if you don't mind me saying, it was</p>
<p>obvious what you were about to do.</p>
<p>If I had wanted to stop you,</p>
<p>it would have been only too easy.</p>
<p>Perhaps it would be prudent</p>
<p>to first teach the students...</p>
<p>...to block unfriendly spells,</p>
<p>professor.</p>
<p>An excellent suggestion,</p>
<p>Professor Snape.</p>
<p>Let's have a volunteer pair.</p>
<p>Potter, Weasley, how about you?</p>
<p>Weasley's wand causes devastation</p>
<p>with the simplest spells.</p>
<p>We'll be sending Potter</p>
<p>to the hospital wing in a matchbox.</p>
<p>Might I suggest someone</p>
<p>from my own house?</p>
<p>Malfoy, perhaps?</p>
<p>Good luck, Potter.</p>
<p>Thank you, sir.</p>
<p>Wands at the ready.</p>
<p>Scared, Potter?</p>
<p>You wish.</p>
<p>On the count of three...</p>
<p>...cast your charms to disarm</p>
<p>your opponent. Only to disarm.</p>
<p>We don't want any accidents here.</p>
<p>One.</p>
<p>Two.</p>
<p>Everte Statum!</p>
<p>Rictusempra!</p>
<p>I said disarm only.</p>
<p>Serpensortia!</p>
<p>Don't move, Potter.</p>
<p>I'll get rid of it for you.</p>
<p>Allow me, Professor Snape.</p>
<p>Alarte Ascendare!</p>
<p>Vipera Evanesca.</p>
<p>What are you playing at?</p>
<p>You're a Parselmouth?</p>
<p>Why didn't you tell us?</p>
<p>I'm a what?</p>
<p>You can talk to snakes.</p>
<p>I know. I accidentally set a python on my cousin Dudley at the zoo once.</p>
<p>Once. But so what?</p>
<p>I bet loads of people here can do it.</p>
<p>No, they can't.</p>
<p>It's not a very common gift, Harry.</p>
<p>This is bad.</p>
<p>What's bad? If I hadn't told that snake not to attack Justin...</p>
<p>That's what you said to it.</p>
<p>You were there. You heard me.</p>
<p>I heard you speaking Parseltongue.</p>
<p>Snake language.</p>
<p>I spoke a different language?</p>
<p>But I didn't realize...</p>
<p>How can I speak a language without knowing I can?</p>
<p>I don't know, but it sounded like you were egging the snake on or something.</p>
<p>Harry, listen to me.</p>
<p>There's a reason the symbol of Slytherin house is a serpent.</p>
<p>Salazar Slytherin was a Parselmouth.</p>
<p>He could talk to snakes too.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Now the whole school's gonna think you're his great-great-great grandson.</p>
<p>But I'm not.</p>
<p>I can't be.</p>
<p>He lived a thousand years ago.</p>
<p>For all we know, you could be.</p>
<p>I'll see you back in the common room.</p>
<p></p><p></p>
<p>I want blood.</p>
<p>They all must die.</p>
<p>Kill.</p>
<p>Kill.</p>
<p>Kill.</p>
<p>Time to kill.</p>
<p>Caught in the act.</p>
<p>I'll have you out this time, Potter.</p>
<p>Mark my words.</p>
<p>No. Mr. Filch! You don't understand...</p>
<p>Professor...</p>
<p>...I swear I didn't.</p>
<p>This is out of my hands, Potter.</p>
<p>Professor Dumbledore</p>
<p>will be waiting for you.</p>
<p>Sherbet Lemon.</p>
<p>Professor Dumbledore?</p>
<p>Bee in your bonnet, Potter?</p>
<p>I was just wondering</p>
<p>if you put me in the right house.</p>
<p>Yes. You were particularly</p>
<p>difficult to place.</p>
<p>But I stand by what I said last year.</p>
<p>You would have done well in Slytherin.</p>
<p>You're wrong.</p>
<p>Harry?</p>
<p>Professor.</p>
<p>Your bird...</p>
<p>There was nothing I could do.</p>
<p>He just caught fire.</p>
<p>And about time too.</p>
<p>He's been looking dreadful for days.</p>
<p>Pity you had to see him</p>
<p>on a burning day.</p>
<p>Fawkes is a phoenix, Harry.</p>
<p>They burst into flame</p>
<p>when it is time for them to die...</p>
<p>...and then they are...</p>
<p>...reborn from the ashes.</p>
<p>Fascinating creatures, phoenixes.</p>
<p>They can carry immensely heavy loads.</p>
<p>Their tears have healing powers.</p>
<p>Professor Dumbledore, sir!</p>
<p>Wait! Listen!</p>
<p>Professor Dumbledore, sir,</p>
<p>it wasn't Harry.</p>
<p>I'd be prepared to swear it</p>
<p>in front of the Ministry of Magic.</p>
<p>Relax.</p>
<p>I do not believe...</p>
<p>...that Harry attacked anyone.</p>
<p>Of course you don't.</p>
<p>Right. Well, I'll...</p>
<p>I'll just wait outside, then.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>You don't think it was me, professor?</p>
<p>No, Harry.</p>
<p>I do not think it was you.</p>
<p>But I must ask you...</p>
<p>...is there something</p>
<p>you wish to tell me?</p>
<p>No, sir.</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>Very well, then.</p>
<p>Off you go.</p>
<p>Everything's set. We just need a bit</p>
<p>of who you're changing into.</p>
<p>Crabbe and Goyle.</p>
<p>We also need to make sure</p>
<p>that the real Crabbe and Goyle...</p>
<p>...can't burst in on us</p>
<p>while we're interrogating Malfoy.</p>
<p>How?</p>
<p>I've got it all worked out.</p>
<p>I filled these</p>
<p>with a simple Sleeping Draught.</p>
<p>Simple, but powerful.</p>
<p>Now, once they're asleep...</p>
<p>...hide them in the broomstick cupboard</p>
<p>and pull out a few of their hairs...</p>
<p>...and put on their uniforms.</p>
<p>Whose hair are you ripping out, then?</p>
<p>I've already got mine.</p>
<p>Millicent Bulstrode. Slytherin.</p>
<p>I got this off her robes.</p>
<p>I'm going to go check</p>
<p>on the Polyjuice Potion.</p>
<p>Make sure that Crabbe and Goyle</p>
<p>find these.</p>
<p>Ron, maybe I should do it.</p>
<p>Yeah. Right.</p>
<p>Wingardium Leviosa.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>How thick could you get?</p>
<p>Come on, let's get them.</p>
<p>We'll have exactly one hour</p>
<p>before we change back into ourselves.</p>
<p>Add the hairs.</p>
<p>Essence of Crabbe.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>
<p>I think I'm gonna be sick.</p>
<p>Me too.</p>
<p>Harry?</p>
<p>Ron.</p>
<p>Bloody hell!</p>
<p>We still sound like ourselves.</p>
<p>You need to sound more like Crabbe.</p>
<p>Bloody hell.</p>
<p>Excellent.</p>
<p>But where's Hermione?</p>
<p>I...</p>
<p>I don't think I'm going.</p>
<p>You go on without me.</p>
<p>Hermione, are you okay?</p>
<p>Just go. You're wasting time.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>I think the Slytherin common room's</p>
<p>this way.</p>
<p>Excuse me.</p>
<p>What are you doing d...?</p>
<p>I mean, what are you doing down here?</p>
<p>I happen to be a school prefect.</p>
<p>You, on the other hand, have no business</p>
<p>wandering the corridors at night.</p>
<p>What are your names again?</p>
<p>I'm...</p>
<p>Crabbe, Goyle, where have you been?</p>
<p>Pigging out in the Great Hall</p>
<p>all this time?</p>
<p>Why are you wearing glasses?</p>
<p>Reading.</p>
<p>Reading?</p>
<p>I didn't know you could read.</p>
<p>And what are you doing down here,</p>
<p>Weasley?</p>
<p>Mind your attitude, Malfoy.</p>
<p>Well, sit down.</p>
<p>You'd never know the Weasleys</p>
<p>were pure-bloods, the way they behave.</p>
<p>They're an embarrassment</p>
<p>to the wizarding world. All of them.</p>
<p>What's wrong with you, Crabbe?</p>
<p>Stomachache.</p>
<p>I'm surprised the Daily Prophet</p>
<p>hasn't done a report on all these attacks.</p>
<p>I suppose Dumbledore</p>
<p>is trying to hush it all up.</p>
<p>Father always said Dumbledore</p>
<p>was the worst thing...</p>
<p>...that ever happened to this place.</p>
<p>You're wrong!</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>You think there's someone here</p>
<p>who's worse than Dumbledore?</p>
<p>Well? Do you?</p>
<p>Harry Potter?</p>
<p>Good one, Goyle.</p>
<p>You're absolutely right.</p>
<p>Saint Potter.</p>
<p>And people actually think</p>
<p>that he's the Heir of Slytherin?</p>
<p>But then you must have some idea</p>
<p>who's behind it all.</p>
<p>You know I don't, Goyle.</p>
<p>I told you yesterday.</p>
<p>How many times do I have to tell you?</p>
<p>Is this yours?</p>
<p>But my father did say this:</p>
<p>It's been 50 years</p>
<p>since the Chamber was opened.</p>
<p>He wouldn't tell me who opened it.</p>
<p>Only that they were expelled.</p>
<p>The last time the Chamber of Secrets</p>
<p>was opened, a Mudblood died.</p>
<p>So it's only a matter of time</p>
<p>before one of them is killed this time.</p>
<p>As for me...</p>
<p>...I hope it's Granger.</p>
<p>What's the matter with you two?</p>
<p>You're acting very odd.</p>
<p>It's his stomachache.</p>
<p>Calm down.</p>
<p>Scar.</p>
<p>Hair.</p>
<p>Hey! Where are you going?</p>
<p>That was close.</p>
<p>Hermione, come out.</p>
<p>We've got loads to tell you.</p>
<p>Go away.</p>
<p>Wait till you see. It's awful.</p>
<p>Hermione?</p>
<p>Are you okay?</p>
<p>Do you remember me telling you...</p>
<p>...that the Polyjuice Potion</p>
<p>was only for human transformations?</p>
<p>It was cat hair I plucked off</p>
<p>Millicent Bulstrode's robes.</p>
<p>Look at my face.</p>
<p>Look at your tail.</p>
<p>Have you spoken to Hermione?</p>
<p>She should be out of hospital</p>
<p>in a few days...</p>
<p>...when she stops coughing up fur balls.</p>
<p>What's this?</p>
<p>Yuck!</p>
<p>Looks like Moaning Myrtle's</p>
<p>flooded the bathroom.</p>
<p>Come to throw something else at me?</p>
<p>Why would I throw something at you?</p>
<p>Don't ask me. Here I am,</p>
<p>minding my own business...</p>
<p>...and someone thinks it's funny</p>
<p>to throw a book at me.</p>
<p>But it can't hurt if someone</p>
<p>throws something at you.</p>
<p>I mean, it'll just go</p>
<p>right through you.</p>
<p>Sure! Let's all throw books at Myrtle</p>
<p>because she can't feel it.</p>
<p>Ten points</p>
<p>if you get it through her stomach!</p>
<p>Fifty points if it goes through her head!</p>
<p>But who threw it at you, anyway?</p>
<p>I don't know. I didn't see them.</p>
<p>I was just sitting in the U-bend,</p>
<p>thinking about death...</p>
<p>...and it fell through the top</p>
<p>of my head.</p>
<p>"Tom Marvolo Riddle."</p>
<p>My name...</p>
<p>...is Harry...</p>
<p>...Potter.</p>
<p>Do you know anything...</p>
<p>...about the Chamber of Secrets?</p>
<p>Can you...</p>
<p>...tell me?</p>
<p>Excuse me. Could you tell me</p>
<p>what's going on here?</p>
<p>Are you Tom Riddle?</p>
<p>Hello, can you hear me?</p>
<p>Riddle!</p>
<p>Come.</p>
<p>Professor Dumbledore.</p>
<p>Dumbledore?</p>
<p>It is not wise to be wandering around</p>
<p>this late hour, Tom.</p>
<p>Yes, professor. I suppose I...</p>
<p>I had to see for myself</p>
<p>if the rumors were true.</p>
<p>I'm afraid they are, Tom.</p>
<p>They are true.</p>
<p>About the school as well?</p>
<p>I don't have a home to go to.</p>
<p>They wouldn't really close Hogwarts,</p>
<p>would they, professor?</p>
<p>I understand, Tom, but I'm afraid...</p>
<p>...Headmaster Dippet</p>
<p>may have no choice.</p>
<p>Sir, if it all stopped,</p>
<p>if the person responsible was caught...</p>
<p>Is there something...</p>
<p>...you wish to tell me?</p>
<p>No, sir. Nothing.</p>
<p>Very well, then. Off you go.</p>
<p>Good night, sir.</p>
<p>Let's get you out of there.</p>
<p>Evening, Hagrid.</p>
<p>I'm going to have to turn you in. I don't</p>
<p>think you meant it to kill anyone...</p>
<p>You can't. You don't understand.</p>
<p>The dead girl's parents will be here</p>
<p>tomorrow. The least Hogwarts can do...</p>
<p>...is make sure the thing that killed</p>
<p>their daughter is slaughtered.</p>
<p>It wasn't him.</p>
<p>Aragog never killed no one. Never.</p>
<p>Monsters don't make good pets, Hagrid.</p>
<p>Now, stand aside.</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>Stand aside, Hagrid.</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>Cistem Aperio!</p>
<p>Arania Exumai!</p>
<p>Aragog!</p>
<p>Aragog!</p>
<p>I can't let you go.</p>
<p>They'll have your wand for this, Hagrid.</p>
<p>You'll be expelled.</p>
<p>Hagrid!</p>
<p>It was Hagrid. Hagrid opened</p>
<p>the Chamber of Secrets 50 years ago.</p>
<p>It can't be Hagrid.</p>
<p>It just can't be.</p>
<p>We don't even know this Tom Riddle.</p>
<p>He sounds like a dirty, rotten snitch.</p>
<p>The monster had killed somebody, Ron.</p>
<p>What would any of us have done?</p>
<p>Look, Hagrid's our friend. Why don't</p>
<p>we just go and ask him about it?</p>
<p>That would be a cheerful visit.</p>
<p>"Hello, Hagrid.</p>
<p>Tell us, have you been setting anything</p>
<p>mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?"</p>
<p>Mad and hairy? You wouldn't be talking</p>
<p>about me, now, would you?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>What's that you've got, Hagrid?</p>
<p>It's Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent.</p>
<p>For the Mandrakes, you know.</p>
<p>Now, according to Professor Sprout,</p>
<p>they've still got a bit of growing to do.</p>
<p>But once their acne's cleared up,</p>
<p>we'll chop them up and stew them...</p>
<p>...and then we'll get those people</p>
<p>down at the hospital un-Petrified.</p>
<p>In the meantime, though, you three...</p>
<p>...had best be looking after yourselves.</p>
<p>All right?</p>
<p>Hello, Neville.</p>
<p>Harry, I don't know who did it,</p>
<p>but you'd better come.</p>
<p>Come on!</p>
<p>It had to be a Gryffindor.</p>
<p>Nobody else knows our password.</p>
<p>Unless it wasn't a student.</p>
<p>Whoever it was, they must have</p>
<p>been looking for something.</p>
<p>And they found it.</p>
<p>Tom Riddle's diary is gone.</p>
<p>All right, listen up.</p>
<p>We play our game,</p>
<p>Hufflepuff doesn't stand a chance.</p>
<p>We're stronger, quicker and smarter.</p>
<p>Not to mention they're dead scared</p>
<p>that Harry will Petrify them...</p>
<p>...if they fly anywhere near him.</p>
<p>Well, that too.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall.</p>
<p>This match has been canceled.</p>
<p>We can't cancel Quidditch.</p>
<p>Silence, Wood. You and your teammates</p>
<p>will go to Gryffindor Tower. Now.</p>
<p>Potter, you and I will find Mr. Weasley.</p>
<p>There's something</p>
<p>the both of you have to see.</p>
<p>I warn you.</p>
<p>This could be a wee bit of a shock.</p>
<p>Hermione!</p>
<p>She was found near the library...</p>
<p>...along with this.</p>
<p>Does it mean anything to either of you?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Could I have your attention, please?</p>
<p>Because of recent events, these new</p>
<p>rules will be put into effect immediately:</p>
<p>"All students will return to their house</p>
<p>common rooms by 6:00 every evening.</p>
<p>All students will be escorted</p>
<p>to each lesson by a teacher.</p>
<p>No exceptions."</p>
<p>I should tell you this:</p>
<p>Unless the culprit</p>
<p>behind these attacks is caught...</p>
<p>...it is likely the school will be closed.</p>
<p>We've got to talk to Hagrid, Ron.</p>
<p>I can't believe it's him...</p>
<p>...but if he did set the monster loose</p>
<p>last time...</p>
<p>...he'll know how to get inside</p>
<p>the Chamber of Secrets. That's a start.</p>
<p>But you heard McGonagall.</p>
<p>We're not allowed to leave</p>
<p>the tower except for class.</p>
<p>I think it's time to get</p>
<p>my dad's old cloak out again.</p>
<p>Who's there?</p>
<p>Hello?</p>
<p>Hello?</p>
<p>What's that for?</p>
<p>Nothing. I was expecting...</p>
<p>It doesn't matter. Come on in.</p>
<p>I just made a pot of tea.</p>
<p>Hagrid, are you okay?</p>
<p>I'm fine. I'm all right.</p>
<p>Did you hear about Hermione?</p>
<p>Yeah. I heard about that, all right.</p>
<p>Look, we have to ask you something.</p>
<p>Do you know who's opened</p>
<p>the Chamber of Secrets?</p>
<p>What you had to understand</p>
<p>about that is...</p>
<p>Quick, under the cloak.</p>
<p>Don't say a word.</p>
<p>Be quiet, both of you.</p>
<p>Professor Dumbledore, sir.</p>
<p>Good evening, Hagrid.</p>
<p>I wonder, could we...?</p>
<p>Of course. Come in. Come in.</p>
<p>That's Dad's boss.</p>
<p>Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic.</p>
<p>Bad business, Hagrid, very bad business.</p>
<p>Had to come.</p>
<p>Three attacks on Muggle-borns.</p>
<p>Things have gone far enough.</p>
<p>The Ministry's got to act.</p>
<p>But I never...</p>
<p>You know I never, professor.</p>
<p>I want it understood, Cornelius...</p>
<p>...that Hagrid...</p>
<p>...has my full confidence.</p>
<p>Albus, look,</p>
<p>Hagrid's record is against him.</p>
<p>I've got to take him.</p>
<p>Take me?</p>
<p>Take me where?</p>
<p>Not Azkaban prison.</p>
<p>I'm afraid we have no choice, Hagrid.</p>
<p>Already here, Fudge?</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>What are you doing here?</p>
<p>Get out of my house!</p>
<p>Believe me...</p>
<p>...I take absolutely no pleasure</p>
<p>being inside your...</p>
<p>You call this a house?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I simply called up the school</p>
<p>and was told the headmaster was here.</p>
<p>Well, what exactly is it</p>
<p>that you want with me?</p>
<p>The other governors and I have decided</p>
<p>it's time for you to step aside.</p>
<p>This is an order of suspension.</p>
<p>You'll find all 12 signatures on it.</p>
<p>I'm afraid we feel</p>
<p>you've rather lost your touch.</p>
<p>Well, what, with all these attacks...</p>
<p>...there'll be no</p>
<p>Muggle-borns left at Hogwarts.</p>
<p>I can only imagine what an awful loss</p>
<p>that would be to the school.</p>
<p>You can't take</p>
<p>Professor Dumbledore away.</p>
<p>Take him away and the Muggle-borns</p>
<p>won't stand a chance.</p>
<p>You mark my words,</p>
<p>there'll be killings next!</p>
<p>You think so?</p>
<p>Calm yourself, Hagrid.</p>
<p>If the governors desire my removal...</p>
<p>...I will, of course, step aside.</p>
<p>However...</p>
<p>...you will find that help</p>
<p>will always be given at Hogwarts...</p>
<p>...to those who...</p>
<p>...ask for it.</p>
<p>Admirable sentiments.</p>
<p>Shall we?</p>
<p>Fudge.</p>
<p>Come, Hagrid.</p>
<p>Well?</p>
<p>Lf...</p>
<p>If anybody was looking for some stuff...</p>
<p>...then all they'd have to do</p>
<p>would be to follow the spiders.</p>
<p>Yep. That would lead them right.</p>
<p>That's all I have to say.</p>
<p>And someone will need</p>
<p>to feed Fang while I'm away.</p>
<p>Good boy.</p>
<p>Hagrid's right.</p>
<p>With Dumbledore gone,</p>
<p>there'll be an attack a day.</p>
<p>Look.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>Come on, Fang.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>You heard what Hagrid said.</p>
<p>"Follow the spiders."</p>
<p>They're heading to the Dark Forest.</p>
<p>Why spiders? Why couldn't it be</p>
<p>"follow the butterflies"?</p>
<p>Harry, I don't like this.</p>
<p>Harry, I don't like this at all.</p>
<p>Shush!</p>
<p>Can we go back now?</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>Who is it?</p>
<p>Don't panic.</p>
<p>Hagrid?</p>
<p>Is that you?</p>
<p>We're friends of Hagrid's.</p>
<p>And you?</p>
<p>You're Aragog, aren't you?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Hagrid has never sent</p>
<p>men into our hollow before.</p>
<p>He's in trouble. Up at the school,</p>
<p>there have been attacks.</p>
<p>They think it's Hagrid.</p>
<p>They think he opened</p>
<p>the Chamber of Secrets. Like before.</p>
<p>That's a lie.</p>
<p>Hagrid never opened</p>
<p>the Chamber of Secrets.</p>
<p>Then you're not the monster?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>The monster was born in the castle.</p>
<p>I came to Hagrid from a distant land</p>
<p>in the pocket of a traveler.</p>
<p>Harry.</p>
<p>But if you're not the monster, then</p>
<p>what did kill that girl 50 years ago?</p>
<p>We do not speak of it.</p>
<p>It is an ancient creature we</p>
<p>spiders fear above all others.</p>
<p>But have you seen it?</p>
<p>I never saw any part of the castle</p>
<p>but the box in which Hagrid kept me.</p>
<p>The girl was discovered</p>
<p>in a bathroom.</p>
<p>When I was accused,</p>
<p>Hagrid brought me here.</p>
<p>Harry!</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Well, thank you.</p>
<p>We'll just go.</p>
<p>Go?</p>
<p>I think not.</p>
<p>My sons and daughters</p>
<p>do not harm Hagrid on my command.</p>
<p>But I cannot deny them</p>
<p>fresh meat...</p>
<p>...when it wanders</p>
<p>so willingly into our midst.</p>
<p>Goodbye, friend of Hagrid.</p>
<p>Can we panic now?</p>
<p>Know any spells?</p>
<p>One, but it's not powerful</p>
<p>enough for all of them.</p>
<p>Where's Hermione when you need her?</p>
<p>Let's go!</p>
<p>Arania Exumai!</p>
<p>Go!</p>
<p>Glad we're out of there.</p>
<p>Arania Exumai!</p>
<p>Thanks for that.</p>
<p>Don't mention it.</p>
<p>Get us out of here.</p>
<p>Now!</p>
<p>Come on!</p>
<p>Come on, move faster!</p>
<p>Come on! Go!</p>
<p>Get us in the air.</p>
<p>The flying gear's jammed!</p>
<p>Come on! Pull!</p>
<p>I'm trying!</p>
<p>Follow the spiders.</p>
<p>Follow the spiders.</p>
<p>If Hagrid ever gets out of Azkaban,</p>
<p>I'll kill him.</p>
<p>I mean, what was the point</p>
<p>of sending us in there?</p>
<p>What have we found out?</p>
<p>We know one thing.</p>
<p>Hagrid never opened</p>
<p>the Chamber of Secrets.</p>
<p>He was innocent.</p>
<p>Wish you were here, Hermione.</p>
<p>We need you.</p>
<p>Now more than ever.</p>
<p>What's that?</p>
<p>Ron...</p>
<p>This is why Hermione was in</p>
<p>the library the day she was attacked.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>"Of the many fearsome beasts</p>
<p>that roam our land...</p>
<p>...none is more deadly than the basilisk.</p>
<p>Capable of living for hundreds of years...</p>
<p>...instant death awaits any who meet</p>
<p>this giant serpent's eye.</p>
<p>Spiders flee before it."</p>
<p>Ron, this is it.</p>
<p>The monster in the Chamber</p>
<p>of Secrets is a basilisk.</p>
<p>That's why I can hear it speak.</p>
<p>It's a snake.</p>
<p>But if it kills by looking people</p>
<p>in the eye, why is it no one's dead?</p>
<p>Because no one did look it</p>
<p>in the eye.</p>
<p>Not directly, at least.</p>
<p>Colin saw it through his camera.</p>
<p>Justin... Justin must have seen the</p>
<p>basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick.</p>
<p>Nick got the full blast of it.</p>
<p>But he's a ghost, he couldn't die again.</p>
<p>And Hermione had the mirror.</p>
<p>I bet you she was using it to look</p>
<p>around corners in case it came along.</p>
<p>And Mrs. Norris?</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure she didn't have</p>
<p>a camera or a mirror, Harry.</p>
<p>The water.</p>
<p>There was water on the floor that night.</p>
<p>She only saw the basilisk's reflection.</p>
<p>"Spiders flee before it."</p>
<p>It all fits.</p>
<p>How's a basilisk been getting around?</p>
<p>A dirty, great snake.</p>
<p>Someone would have seen it.</p>
<p>Hermione's answered that too.</p>
<p>Pipes? It's using the plumbing.</p>
<p>Remember what Aragog said</p>
<p>about that girl 50 years ago?</p>
<p>She died in a bathroom?</p>
<p>What if she never left?</p>
<p>Moaning Myrtle.</p>
<p>All students are to return</p>
<p>to their house dormitories at once.</p>
<p>All teachers to the second-floor</p>
<p>corridor immediately.</p>
<p>As you can see, the Heir of Slytherin</p>
<p>has left another message.</p>
<p>Our worst fear has been realized.</p>
<p>A student has been taken by the monster</p>
<p>into the Chamber itself.</p>
<p>The students must be sent home.</p>
<p>I'm afraid this is the end of Hogwarts.</p>
<p>So sorry. Dozed off.</p>
<p>What have I missed?</p>
<p>A girl has been snatched by the monster,</p>
<p>Lockhart. Your moment has come at last.</p>
<p>My moment?</p>
<p>Weren't you saying just last night...</p>
<p>...that you've known all along where the</p>
<p>entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is?</p>
<p>That's settled. We'll leave you</p>
<p>to deal with the monster, Gilderoy.</p>
<p>Your skills, after all, are legend.</p>
<p>Very well.</p>
<p>I'll just be in my office getting...</p>
<p>Getting ready.</p>
<p>Who is it that the monster's taken,</p>
<p>Minerva?</p>
<p>Ginny Weasley.</p>
<p>"Her skeleton will lie</p>
<p>in the Chamber forever."</p>
<p>Ginny.</p>
<p>Lockhart may be useless, but he's</p>
<p>going to try and get into the Chamber.</p>
<p>At least we can tell him</p>
<p>what we know.</p>
<p>Professor, we have some information</p>
<p>for you.</p>
<p>Are you going somewhere?</p>
<p>Well, yes. Urgent call. Unavoidable.</p>
<p>Got to go.</p>
<p>What about my sister?</p>
<p>Well...</p>
<p>As to that, most unfortunate.</p>
<p>No one regrets more than I.</p>
<p>You're the Defense Against the Dark</p>
<p>Arts teacher. You can't go now.</p>
<p>I must say, when I took the job,</p>
<p>there was nothing in the description...</p>
<p>You're running away?</p>
<p>After all you did in your books?</p>
<p>Books can be misleading.</p>
<p>You wrote them.</p>
<p>My dear boy, use your common sense.</p>
<p>My books wouldn't have sold as well if</p>
<p>people didn't think I'd done those things.</p>
<p>You're a fraud.</p>
<p>You've been taking credit</p>
<p>for what other wizards have done.</p>
<p>Is there anything you can do?</p>
<p>Yes, now you mention it.</p>
<p>I'm rather gifted with Memory Charms.</p>
<p>Otherwise, all those wizards</p>
<p>would have gone blabbing.</p>
<p>I'd never have sold another book.</p>
<p>In fact, I'm going to have to do</p>
<p>the same to you.</p>
<p>Don't even think about it.</p>
<p>Who's there?</p>
<p>Hello, Harry.</p>
<p>What do you want?</p>
<p>To ask you how you died.</p>
<p>It was dreadful.</p>
<p>It happened right here</p>
<p>in this very cubicle.</p>
<p>I'd hidden because Olive Hornby</p>
<p>was teasing me about my glasses.</p>
<p>I was crying, and then</p>
<p>I heard somebody come in.</p>
<p>Who was it, Myrtle?</p>
<p>I don't know. I was distraught!</p>
<p>But they said something funny,</p>
<p>a kind of made-up language.</p>
<p>And I realized it was a boy, so I unlocked</p>
<p>the door to tell him to go away and...</p>
<p>...I died.</p>
<p>Just like that? How?</p>
<p>I just remember seeing a pair</p>
<p>of great, big, yellow eyes...</p>
<p>...over there by that sink.</p>
<p>This is it.</p>
<p>This is it, Ron. I think this is</p>
<p>the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets.</p>
<p>Say something. Harry,</p>
<p>say something in Parseltongue.</p>
<p>Excellent, Harry. Good work.</p>
<p>Well, then, I'll just be...</p>
<p>There's no need for me to stay.</p>
<p>Yes, there is.</p>
<p>You first.</p>
<p>Now, boys, what good will it do?</p>
<p>Better you than us.</p>
<p>But... Obviously, yes.</p>
<p>Sure you don't want to test it first?</p>
<p>It's really quite filthy down here.</p>
<p>All right. Let's go.</p>
<p>Oh, Harry?</p>
<p>If you die down there,</p>
<p>you're welcome to share my toilet.</p>
<p>Thanks, Myrtle.</p>
<p>Now, remember: Any sign of movement,</p>
<p>close your eyes straightaway.</p>
<p>Go on.</p>
<p>This way.</p>
<p>What's this?</p>
<p>It looks like a snake.</p>
<p>It's a snakeskin.</p>
<p>Bloody hell.</p>
<p>Whatever shed this must be</p>
<p>Heart of a lion, this one.</p>
<p>The adventure ends here, boys.</p>
<p>But don't fret.</p>
<p>The world will know our story.</p>
<p>How I was too late to save the girl.</p>
<p>How you two</p>
<p>tragically lost your minds...</p>
<p>...at the sight of her mangled body.</p>
<p>So...</p>
<p>You first, Mr. Potter.</p>
<p>Say goodbye to your memories.</p>
<p>Obliviate!</p>
<p>Ron! Ron, are you okay?</p>
<p>I'm fine.</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>Who are you?</p>
<p>Ron Weasley.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>And who am I?</p>
<p>Lockhart's Memory Charm backfired.</p>
<p>He hasn't got a clue who he is.</p>
<p>It's an odd sort of place, isn't it?</p>
<p>Do you live here?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>What do I do now?</p>
<p>You wait here...</p>
<p>...and try and shift some of this rock</p>
<p>so we can get back through.</p>
<p>I'll go on and find Ginny.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Ginny! Ginny, please don't be dead.</p>
<p>Wake up, wake up.</p>
<p>Please wake up.</p>
<p>She won't wake.</p>
<p>Tom. Tom Riddle.</p>
<p>What do you mean, she won't wake?</p>
<p>She's not...?</p>
<p>She's still alive, but only just.</p>
<p>Are you a ghost?</p>
<p>A memory...</p>
<p>...preserved in a diary for 50 years.</p>
<p>She's cold as ice.</p>
<p>Ginny, please don't be dead. Wake up.</p>
<p>You've got to help me, Tom.</p>
<p>There's a basilisk.</p>
<p>It won't come until it's called.</p>
<p>Give me my wand, Tom.</p>
<p>You won't be needing it.</p>
<p>We've got to go. We've got to save her.</p>
<p>I'm afraid I can't do that.</p>
<p>You see, as poor Ginny grows weaker,</p>
<p>I grow stronger.</p>
<p>Yes, Harry, it was Ginny Weasley</p>
<p>who opened the Chamber of Secrets.</p>
<p>No. She couldn't. She wouldn't.</p>
<p>It was Ginny who set the basilisk</p>
<p>on the Mudbloods and Filch's cat...</p>
<p>...Ginny who wrote the threatening</p>
<p>messages on the walls.</p>
<p>But why?</p>
<p>Because I told her to.</p>
<p>You'll find I can be very persuasive.</p>
<p>Not that she knew what she was doing.</p>
<p>She was, shall we say,</p>
<p>in a kind of trance.</p>
<p>Still, the power of the diary</p>
<p>began to scare her.</p>
<p>She tried to dispose of it</p>
<p>in the girls' bathroom.</p>
<p>And then who should find it but you?</p>
<p>The very person</p>
<p>I was most anxious to meet.</p>
<p>And why did you want to meet me?</p>
<p>I knew I had to talk to you,</p>
<p>meet you if I could.</p>
<p>So I decided to show you my capture</p>
<p>of that brainless oaf Hagrid...</p>
<p>...to gain your trust.</p>
<p>Hagrid's my friend.</p>
<p>And you framed him, didn't you?</p>
<p>It was my word against Hagrid's.</p>
<p>Only Dumbledore seemed to think</p>
<p>he was innocent.</p>
<p>I'll bet Dumbledore saw</p>
<p>right through you.</p>
<p>He certainly kept an annoyingly close</p>
<p>watch on me after that.</p>
<p>I knew it wouldn't be safe to open the</p>
<p>Chamber again while I was at school...</p>
<p>...so I decided to leave behind</p>
<p>a diary...</p>
<p>...preserving my 16-year-old self</p>
<p>in its pages...</p>
<p>...so that one day</p>
<p>I would be able to lead another...</p>
<p>...to finish Salazar Slytherin's</p>
<p>noble work.</p>
<p>Well, you haven't finished it</p>
<p>this time.</p>
<p>In a few hours, the Mandrake Draught</p>
<p>will be ready.</p>
<p>And everyone who was Petrified</p>
<p>will be all right again.</p>
<p>Haven't I told you? Killing Mudbloods</p>
<p>doesn't matter to me anymore.</p>
<p>For many months now,</p>
<p>my new target has been you.</p>
<p>How is it that a baby</p>
<p>with no extraordinary magical talent...</p>
<p>...was able to defeat the greatest wizard</p>
<p>of all time?</p>
<p>How did you escape with nothing</p>
<p>but a scar...</p>
<p>...while Lord Voldemort's powers</p>
<p>were destroyed?</p>
<p>Why do you care how I escaped?</p>
<p>Voldemort was after your time.</p>
<p>Voldemort is my past,</p>
<p>present and future.</p>
<p>You. You're the Heir of Slytherin.</p>
<p>You're Voldemort.</p>
<p>Surely you didn't think...</p>
<p>...I was going to keep</p>
<p>my filthy Muggle father's name?</p>
<p>No. I fashioned myself a new name,</p>
<p>a name I knew wizards everywhere...</p>
<p>...would fear to speak when I became</p>
<p>the greatest sorcerer in the world.</p>
<p>Albus Dumbledore</p>
<p>is the greatest sorcerer in the world.</p>
<p>Dumbledore's been driven out of</p>
<p>this castle by the mere memory of me.</p>
<p>He'll never be gone. Not as long as</p>
<p>those who remain are loyal to him.</p>
<p>Fawkes?</p>
<p>So this is what Dumbledore</p>
<p>sends his great defender.</p>
<p>A songbird and an old hat.</p>
<p>Let's match the power of Lord</p>
<p>Voldemort, Heir of Salazar Slytherin...</p>
<p>...against the famous Harry Potter.</p>
<p>Parseltongue won't save you now,</p>
<p>Potter. It only obeys me.</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>Your bird may have blinded the basilisk,</p>
<p>but it can still hear you.</p>
<p>Yes, Potter.</p>
<p>The process is nearly complete.</p>
<p>In a few minutes, Ginny Weasley will be</p>
<p>dead, and I will cease to be a memory.</p>
<p>Lord Voldemort will return...</p>
<p>...very much alive.</p>
<p>Ginny?</p>
<p>Remarkable, isn't it...</p>
<p>...how quickly the venom</p>
<p>of the basilisk penetrates the body?</p>
<p>I'd guess you have little more</p>
<p>than a minute to live.</p>
<p>You'll be with your dear</p>
<p>Mudblood mother soon, Harry.</p>
<p>Funny, the damage a silly</p>
<p>little book can do...</p>
<p>...especially in the hands</p>
<p>of a silly little girl.</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>Stop. No!</p>
<p>It was me.</p>
<p>But I swear, I didn't mean to.</p>
<p>Riddle made me, and...</p>
<p>Harry, you're hurt.</p>
<p>Don't worry.</p>
<p>Ginny, you need</p>
<p>to get yourself out.</p>
<p>Follow the Chamber</p>
<p>and you'll find Ron.</p>
<p>You were brilliant, Fawkes.</p>
<p>I just wasn't quick enough.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>Phoenix tears have healing powers.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>It's all right, Ginny.</p>
<p>It's over.</p>
<p>It's just a memory.</p>
<p>Amazing!</p>
<p>This is just like magic!</p>
<p>You both realize, of course...</p>
<p>...that in the past few hours, you have</p>
<p>broken perhaps a dozen school rules.</p>
<p>Yes, sir.</p>
<p>There is sufficient evidence</p>
<p>to have you both expelled.</p>
<p>Yes, sir.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is only fitting...</p>
<p>...that you both receive...</p>
<p>...Special Awards for Services</p>
<p>to the School.</p>
<p>Thanks, sir.</p>
<p>Now, Mr. Weasley, if you would...</p>
<p>...have an owl deliver these</p>
<p>release papers to Azkaban.</p>
<p>I believe we want</p>
<p>our gamekeeper back.</p>
<p>First, I want to thank you, Harry.</p>
<p>You must have shown me</p>
<p>real loyalty down in the Chamber.</p>
<p>Nothing but that</p>
<p>could have called Fawkes to you.</p>
<p>And...</p>
<p>...second...</p>
<p>...I sense that something</p>
<p>is troubling you.</p>
<p>Am I right, Harry?</p>
<p>It's just...</p>
<p>You see, sir, I couldn't help</p>
<p>but notice certain things, certain...</p>
<p>Certain similarities</p>
<p>between Tom Riddle and me.</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>Well, you can speak</p>
<p>Parseltongue, Harry. Why?</p>
<p>Because Lord Voldemort</p>
<p>can speak Parseltongue.</p>
<p>If I'm not mistaken, Harry...</p>
<p>...he transferred</p>
<p>some of his powers to you...</p>
<p>...the night he gave you that scar.</p>
<p>Voldemort transferred</p>
<p>some of his powers to me?</p>
<p>Not intentionally...</p>
<p>...but yes.</p>
<p>So the Sorting Hat was right.</p>
<p>I should be in Slytherin.</p>
<p>It's true. You possess many of the</p>
<p>qualities that Voldemort himself prizes.</p>
<p>Determination, resourcefulness...</p>
<p>...and if I may say so,</p>
<p>a certain disregard for the rules.</p>
<p>Why, then, did the Sorting Hat</p>
<p>place you in Gryffindor?</p>
<p>Because I asked it to.</p>
<p>Exactly, Harry. Exactly.</p>
<p>Which makes you different</p>
<p>from Voldemort.</p>
<p>It is not our abilities</p>
<p>that show what we truly are.</p>
<p>It is our choices.</p>
<p>If you want proof</p>
<p>why you belong in Gryffindor...</p>
<p>...then I suggest</p>
<p>you look more closely at this.</p>
<p>Be careful.</p>
<p>Godric Gryffindor.</p>
<p>It would take a true Gryffindor</p>
<p>to pull that out of the hat.</p>
<p>Dobby.</p>
<p>So this is your master.</p>
<p>The family you serve is the Malfoys.</p>
<p>I'll deal with you later.</p>
<p>Out of my way, Potter.</p>
<p>So it's true. You have returned.</p>
<p>When the governors learned that</p>
<p>Arthur Weasley's daughter...</p>
<p>...was taken into the Chamber,</p>
<p>they saw fit to summon me back.</p>
<p>Ridiculous.</p>
<p>Curiously, Lucius, several of them...</p>
<p>...were under the impression</p>
<p>that you would curse their family...</p>
<p>...if they did not agree</p>
<p>to suspend me in the first place.</p>
<p>How dare you!</p>
<p>Beg your pardon?</p>
<p>My sole concern has always been</p>
<p>and will always be...</p>
<p>...the welfare of this school...</p>
<p>...and, of course, its students.</p>
<p>The culprit has been identified,</p>
<p>I presume?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And?</p>
<p>Who was it?</p>
<p>Voldemort.</p>
<p>Only this time he chose to act</p>
<p>through somebody else...</p>
<p>...by means of this.</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>Fortunately, our young Mr. Potter</p>
<p>discovered it.</p>
<p>One hopes that no more of Lord</p>
<p>Voldemort's old school-things...</p>
<p>...should find their way</p>
<p>into innocent hands.</p>
<p>The consequences for the one</p>
<p>responsible would be...</p>
<p>...severe.</p>
<p>Well, let us hope...</p>
<p>...that Mr. Potter will always</p>
<p>be around to save the day.</p>
<p>Don't worry. I will be.</p>
<p>Dumbledore.</p>
<p>Come, Dobby. We're leaving.</p>
<p>Sir?</p>
<p>I wonder if I could have that?</p>
<p>Mr. Malfoy.</p>
<p>Mr. Malfoy!</p>
<p>I have something of yours.</p>
<p>Mine? I don't know</p>
<p>what you're talking about.</p>
<p>I think you do, sir.</p>
<p>I think you slipped the diary</p>
<p>into Ginny Weasley's cauldron...</p>
<p>...that day at Diagon Alley.</p>
<p>You do, do you?</p>
<p>Why don't you prove it?</p>
<p>Come, Dobby.</p>
<p>Open it.</p>
<p>Dobby.</p>
<p>Master has given Dobby a sock.</p>
<p>What? I didn't give...</p>
<p>Master has presented Dobby</p>
<p>with clothes.</p>
<p>Dobby is free.</p>
<p>You lost me my servant!</p>
<p>You shall not harm Harry Potter.</p>
<p>Your parents were</p>
<p>meddlesome fools too.</p>
<p>Mark my words, Potter.</p>
<p>One day soon...</p>
<p>...you are going to meet</p>
<p>the same sticky end.</p>
<p>Harry Potter freed Dobby.</p>
<p>How can Dobby ever repay him?</p>
<p>Just promise me something.</p>
<p>Anything, sir.</p>
<p>Never try to save my life again.</p>
<p>Welcome back, Sir Nicholas.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Good evening, Sir Nicholas.</p>
<p>Good evening.</p>
<p>Good to see you, Sir Nicholas.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>Hermione! Welcome back.</p>
<p>Thanks, Sir Nicholas.</p>
<p>Harry. It's Hermione.</p>
<p>Welcome back, Hermione.</p>
<p>It's good to be back.</p>
<p>Congratulations.</p>
<p>I can't believe you solved it.</p>
<p>We had loads of help from you.</p>
<p>We couldn't have done it without you.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Could I have your attention, please?</p>
<p>Before we begin the feast...</p>
<p>...let us have a round of applause</p>
<p>for Professor Sprout, Madam Pomfrey...</p>
<p>...whose Mandrake juice has been</p>
<p>so successfully administered...</p>
<p>...to all who had been Petrified.</p>
<p>Also, in light of the recent events...</p>
<p>...as a school treat...</p>
<p>...all exams have been canceled.</p>
<p>Oh, no.</p>
<p>Sorry I'm late.</p>
<p>The owl that delivered my release papers</p>
<p>got all lost and confused.</p>
<p>Some ruddy bird called Errol.</p>
<p>And I'd just like to say that if it hadn't</p>
<p>been for you, Harry and Ron...</p>
<p>...and Hermione, of course...</p>
<p>...I would still be you-know-where...</p>
<p>...so I'd just like to say thanks.</p>
<p>There's no Hogwarts</p>
<p>without you, Hagrid.</p>
<p>Year One. On his 11 th birthday...</p>
<p>... Harry Potter discovered a secret that</p>
<p>changed the course of his life forever.</p>
<p>You're a wizard, Harry.</p>
<p>I'm a what?</p>
<p>Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone.</p>
<p>"Dear Mr. Potter,</p>
<p>We are pleased to accept you...</p>
<p>...at Hogwarts School</p>
<p>of Witchcraft and Wizardry."</p>
<p>I'm Ron, by the way.</p>
<p>I'm Hermione Granger.</p>
<p>I'm Harry. Harry Potter.</p>
<p>Harry Potter.</p>
<p>Mr. Potter.</p>
<p>Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts.</p>
<p>Shortly, you'll pass through</p>
<p>these doors and join your classmates.</p>
<p>The first years, please note that the</p>
<p>Dark Forest is strictly forbidden.</p>
<p>Also, the third-floor corridor</p>
<p>is out of bounds...</p>
<p>...to everyone who does not wish</p>
<p>to die a most painful death.</p>
<p>Troll in the dungeon!</p>
<p>Hermione, move!</p>
<p>Thought you ought to know.</p>
<p>Quick, let's hide through that door!</p>
<p>It's locked!</p>
<p>We're done for!</p>
<p>Move over! Alohomora.</p>
<p>It was locked.</p>
<p>And for good reason.</p>
<p>Understand this, Harry:</p>
<p>Not all wizards are good.</p>
<p>Mr. Potter. Our new celebrity.</p>
<p>But you are a Seeker.</p>
<p>And the game begins.</p>
<p>Someone's going to try and steal</p>
<p>the Philosopher's Stone.</p>
<p>Petrificus Totalus.</p>
<p>You're a great wizard. You really are.</p>
<p>Ron!</p>
<p>And now, Year Two:</p>
<p>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.</p>
